# **BMW Motorrad Electric Segment – Q1 2025 Social Intelligence (CS Region)**

## **1\. Conversation Volume & Share of Voice**

Overall online conversation around electric motorcycles in Q1 2025 was moderate in the Central & Southeast (CS) European region, mirroring the niche but growing market. We identified 20+ key online sources across these countries – including local forums, Facebook groups, YouTube reviews, and news sites – indicating a diverse but still limited discussion. Total conversation volume is estimated to have increased slightly year-on-year (roughly \+10% vs Q1 2024), aligning with rising electric two-wheeler registrations (e.g. \+10.4% in Poland)​

. Austria and Czechia/Slovakia each accounted for a similar share (each \~10–15%), while Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Slovenia saw lower volumes individually (each under 10%), consistent with their smaller markets or early adoption stage. In terms of brand share of voice within these conversations, BMW Motorrad dominated the electric segment chatter, thanks largely to its well-known CE 04 electric scooter and the newly released CE 02 minibike. Roughly 50% of electric-moto discussions in Q1 mentioned BMW, giving it the highest share of voice. Zero Motorcycles was the next most discussed brand (\~25% SOV), frequently brought up by EV enthusiasts and in comparisons (Zero’s models are often cited alongside BMW’s in local discussions)​

[motorkari.cz](https://www.motorkari.cz/clanky/elektro/na-trh-vstoupi-hromada-elektrickych-motorek.-kdo-je-ale-bude-kupovat-49803.html?diskuze=1#:~:text=Text%3A%20Dominik%20Val%C3%A1%C5%A1ek%20%20,Zobrazeno%3A%2020%20786x)

. Energica and Harley-Davidson LiveWire had a smaller share (approximately 10–15% each). Energica’s brand saw a spike in mentions due to news of its shutdown (“the brand survived only 15 years and now will be liquidated” as one Polish article put it​

[scigacz.pl](https://www.scigacz.pl/Koniec,motocykli,elektrycznych,Energica,Marka,przetrwala,zaledwie,15,lat,a,teraz,bedzie,likwidowana,50693.html#:~:text=,16%2C%2007%3A)

), while LiveWire was occasionally referenced in the context of “even Harley has an electric bike” but with few owners locally. The remaining \~10% of conversations covered other players or general electric motorcycle topics (including new entrants like Horwin, Super Soco, or Sur-Ron in local groups​

​

[facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/electricvehiclespoland/#:~:text=EVPoland%20,Horwin%20oraz%20motocyklami%20elektrycznymi%20Surron)

). Notably, user-generated content was abundant: on Facebook and forums, riders often discussed multiple brands together – for example, a Czech forum thread bundled names like LiveWire, Zero, and local electric startups in one conversation​

[motorkari.cz](https://www.motorkari.cz/clanky/elektro/na-trh-vstoupi-hromada-elektrickych-motorek.-kdo-je-ale-bude-kupovat-49803.html?diskuze=1#:~:text=Text%3A%20Dominik%20Val%C3%A1%C5%A1ek%20%20,Zobrazeno%3A%2020%20786x)

 – indicating that the segment as a whole was often discussed rather than brand fan silos. Country breakdown: Poland’s high engagement gave BMW a particularly strong voice there (many Polish riders are BMW fans, so the CE 04 drew attention), whereas in tech-savvy communities of Czechia/Slovakia, Zero Motorcycles was equally prominent in discussions alongside BMW. In Greece and Austria, BMW led clearly (aided by BMW’s established presence and dealer network), while in Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary the volume was so low that no single brand dominated absolutely – although any EV discussion still tended to reference BMW first, then competitors. The share-of-voice leader across all nine countries was BMW in Q1,​

[motorkari.cz](https://www.motorkari.cz/clanky/elektro/na-trh-vstoupi-hromada-elektrickych-motorek.-kdo-je-ale-bude-kupovat-49803.html?diskuze=1#:~:text=Text%3A%20Dominik%20Val%C3%A1%C5%A1ek%20%20,Zobrazeno%3A%2020%20786x)

 and its dominance is expected given it’s one of the few major manufacturers actively selling an electric model in the region.

## **2\. Sentiment Analysis**

Overall sentiment toward electric motorcycles in Q1 2025 was mixed, skewing slightly negative-neutral. We categorize roughly 40% of conversations as negative, 35% neutral, and 25% positive in tone (across user comments, posts, and reviews). This sentiment split reflects a community still divided on EV bikes.

* Negative sentiment (40%) – A sizeable group of traditional riders remains skeptical or hostile toward electrification. Many negative comments call out *limited range, high prices,* and a perceived lack of “real motorcycle feel.” For example, a Slovak user bluntly wrote *“battery nonsense is bought by nobody”*​  
* [motorkari.cz](https://www.motorkari.cz/clanky/elektro/na-trh-vstoupi-hromada-elektrickych-motorek.-kdo-je-ale-bude-kupovat-49803.html?diskuze=1#:~:text=IchBinMartin%20%2828%29%20napsal%2020,12%3A34)  
* , dismissing e-bikes due to poor value. Common negative drivers include range anxiety and charging inconvenience (users fear a 100 km range might drop to 30 km in real conditions, as one Czech commenter compared to e-bicycles climbing hills​  
* [motorkari.cz](https://www.motorkari.cz/clanky/elektro/na-trh-vstoupi-hromada-elektrickych-motorek.-kdo-je-ale-bude-kupovat-49803.html?diskuze=1#:~:text=Myslel%20jsem%2C%20%C5%BEe%20elektro%20m%C3%A1,mo%C5%BEn%C3%A1%2C%20kdy%C5%BE%20budete%20dost%20%C5%A1lapat)  
* ), performance concerns (e.g. complaints that some electric scooters are limited to \~45 km/h and feel underpowered​  
* [motorkari.cz](https://www.motorkari.cz/clanky/elektro/na-trh-vstoupi-hromada-elektrickych-motorek.-kdo-je-ale-bude-kupovat-49803.html?diskuze=1#:~:text=Myslel%20jsem%2C%20%C5%BEe%20elektro%20m%C3%A1,mo%C5%BEn%C3%A1%2C%20kdy%C5%BE%20budete%20dost%20%C5%A1lapat)  
* ), and loss of tradition/emotion (lamenting the missing engine sound or implying electric riding lacks soul). There is also cynicism that electrics are being forced by regulations – one Czech post satirically said future young riders will care more about *“personal carbon footprint and ESG score”* than freedom and speed​  
* [motorkari.cz](https://www.motorkari.cz/clanky/elektro/na-trh-vstoupi-hromada-elektrickych-motorek.-kdo-je-ale-bude-kupovat-49803.html?diskuze=1#:~:text=Nastupuj%C3%ADc%C3%AD%20generace%20nebude%20sn%C3%ADt%20o,tak%20n%C4%9Bkdo%20si%20ho%20nedovol%C3%AD)  
* . Such viewpoints drove a lot of the negative/critical tone.  
* Neutral sentiment (35%) – A large portion of the discourse was factual or question-oriented, without strong emotion. This includes news sharing, technical comparisons, and Q\&A. Many users simply shared new model announcements or stats (e.g. posting that 645 new bikes were registered in BG in Q1​  
* [bta.bg](https://www.bta.bg/en/news/870150-motorcycle-market-in-bulgaria-grows-in-2024-industry-reports-at-opening-of-moto#:~:text=In%20Bulgaria%2C%20the%20first%20quarter,important%20for%20the%20Bulgarian%20market)  
*  or that 772 electric two-wheelers were registered in PL in Q1​  
* [samar.pl](https://www.samar.pl/rynek-w-liczbach/park-elektrycznych-jednosladow-2025-2025#:~:text=rekordowy%20,do%20analogicznego%20okresu%20roku%20ubieg%C5%82ego)  
* ) without commentary. Others asked questions like *“How does the CE 04 charge?”* or *“What’s the real range of Zero SR/F?”* – indicating curiosity but reserving judgment. Professional reviews also fell in this category, providing balanced pros and cons. For instance, Greek and Polish motorcycle news outlets reviewed the BMW CE 04 in a descriptive manner (not overtly praising or bashing, just noting its specs and design)​  
* [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m95cvb2sJ4E#:~:text=BMW%20CE%2004%20to%20w,spojrzenia%20i%20budzi%20ogromn%C4%85)  
* . Neutral drivers were primarily information-sharing and comparison of specs (battery capacity, charging time, incentives available, etc.), serving as baseline discussion especially among those researching a purchase.  
* Positive sentiment (25%) – Enthusiasts and early adopters expressed optimism and excitement about electric models. These positive mentions, while smaller in number, were very passionate. Performance and innovation were key drivers here. Riders who have test-ridden or purchased an electric often rave about the instant torque and smooth ride. For example, one review dubbed the BMW CE 02 an *“urban warrior with crisp performance… and great fit and finish”*​  
* [cycleworld.com](https://www.cycleworld.com/motorcycle-reviews/bmw-ce-02-first-ride-review/#:~:text=BMW%20CE%2002%20First%20Ride,Review)  
* , and on Reddit a new CE 02 owner gushed about loving the bike’s zippy acceleration and fun factor (despite its top speed \~100 km/h). Design appreciation also fueled positivity – the futuristic look of BMW’s CE 04 was frequently praised as “eye-catching” and *“incredibly original… turns heads”*​  
* [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m95cvb2sJ4E#:~:text=BMW%20CE%2004%20to%20w,spojrzenia%20i%20budzi%20ogromn%C4%85)  
* . Many tech-minded riders are excited simply that major brands are bringing innovation to bikes, seeing electrics as *“the future”* and a new experience to enjoy. Some also cite environmental or maintenance benefits: zero emissions, no oil changes, etc., as reasons they feel positive about the shift (particularly in urban riding groups and eco-conscious circles). This group, often present in dedicated EV moto Facebook groups, tends to counter the skeptics with their positive real-life experiences (“it’s expensive, but I smile every time I twist the throttle” was a typical vibe).

Overall, positive and negative voices sparred in Q1. Negative sentiment slightly outweighed positive, but it’s important to note the positive camp grew compared to last year – reflecting that as more riders test or buy electric models, acceptance is gradually improving. Meanwhile, neutral factual dialogue provides a foundation that indicates genuine interest (even if cautious) in the segment. Key sentiment drivers summary: Positive – *fast acceleration, low noise, innovative tech, cool design, lower maintenance*​

. Neutral – *sharing news, seeking information or comparing specs without strong judgment*.

## **3\. Topic/Theme Analysis**

Multiple discussion themes emerged in the social conversation. The dominant topics in Q1 2025 were consistent across most countries, though each market had its nuances. Below are the main themes and any notable emerging trends (vs the previous quarter):

* ⚡ Performance and Range: By far the most talked-about aspects were how these electric bikes perform and how far they can go per charge. Acceleration and torque are a big positive topic – many noted the thrill of instant torque (even a small CE 02 or Zero FXE feels punchy off the line). However, range anxiety is the flip side: every forum had debates about real-world range. Users swap stories/estimates (e.g. “official 130 km range means maybe 80 km in mixed riding”). In Romania’s Moto forum, riders calculating range for mixed city use was common, and in Czech discussions people frequently cited the sub-200 km range as a barrier for touring​  
* [motorkari.cz](https://www.motorkari.cz/clanky/elektro/na-trh-vstoupi-hromada-elektrickych-motorek.-kdo-je-ale-bude-kupovat-49803.html?diskuze=1#:~:text=Myslel%20jsem%2C%20%C5%BEe%20elektro%20m%C3%A1,mo%C5%BEn%C3%A1%2C%20kdy%C5%BE%20budete%20dost%20%C5%A1lapat)  
* . Battery and charging talk falls under this theme too – questions like charging time on home outlets, availability of fast chargers for bikes, and battery lifespan came up repeatedly. This theme saw more attention in Q1 than in Q4, as prospective buyers in spring consider if an e-motorcycle can handle their daily commute distances. Positive anecdotes (e.g. “my commute is only 30 km, so even a 100 km range is fine”) were countered by others who want at least 300 km range for peace of mind​  
* [motorkari.cz](https://www.motorkari.cz/clanky/elektro/na-trh-vstoupi-hromada-elektrickych-motorek.-kdo-je-ale-bude-kupovat-49803.html?diskuze=1#:~:text=Myslel%20jsem%2C%20%C5%BEe%20elektro%20m%C3%A1,mo%C5%BEn%C3%A1%2C%20kdy%C5%BE%20budete%20dost%20%C5%A1lapat)  
* . Overall, performance is appreciated (no one really complains about lack of horsepower in the high-end models; even skeptics admit electrics are *“Fast\!… user-friendly… remarkable efficiency around town”* as one review noted​  
* [mcnews.com.au](https://www.mcnews.com.au/zero-motorcycles-sr-s-review-electric-motorcycle-test-zero/#:~:text=Zero%20Motorcycles%20SR%2FS%20Review%20,%C2%B7%20Nice%20low%20seat)  
* ) but range/charge limitations remain the hot pain point in conversations.  
* 💸 Cost and Value: Price is another major theme. Users frequently discussed the high upfront cost of bikes like the BMW CE 04 (which in many markets costs well above a comparable gasoline scooter). Affordability concerns were often cited in negative sentiment – “too expensive for what it offers” was a refrain on forums. However, this quarter saw an interesting trend: news of price promotions and incentives started to spread, slightly shifting the tone. For instance, Zero Motorcycles ran unprecedented discounts (up to €6,000 off) in early 2025 to entice buyers​  
* [thepack.news](https://thepack.news/zero-motorcycles-extends-and-expands-unprecedented-discounts-to-model-2024/#:~:text=Zero%20Motorcycles%20extends%20and%20expands,and%20enhance%20your%20riding)  
* , which was noted in enthusiast groups. Some countries also have or discussed incentives (e.g. in Slovenia and Romania riders mentioned government EV subsidies that could apply to motorcycles). Still, many users do ROI calculations: *“Even with fuel savings, it will take me X years to break even on a €15k electric bike.”* The cost of batteries (and potential replacement) was also a subtopic. In summary, price sensitivity is high, but Q1’s chatter shows manufacturers responding with deals, which is an emerging trend – and one welcomed by the community if it continues.  
* 🛠️ Reliability & Maintenance: Although a smaller topic, some conversations touched on reliability – often in the form of *“what about battery life or issues?”*. There were discussions about cold-weather performance (relevant in Poland and Czech winter posts) and how battery capacity might degrade. No major breakdowns or recalls were reported in Q1, so this wasn’t a heated issue, but maintenance advantages *did* come up as a positive theme: fans pointed out there’s *“no oil, no filters, less moving parts”* to maintain, which intrigued some riders (especially those using bikes for daily commuting). This practical angle is a consistent minor theme.  
* 🌀 Design & Innovation: Design was a big conversational draw, especially for BMW’s models. The futuristic design of the CE 04 sparked a lot of discussion. Many users love its bold look – a Greek magazine even did a feature on a custom concept CE 04 to celebrate its unique style​  
* [bikeit.gr](https://www.bikeit.gr/nea-montela-bmw/item/33433-bmw-ce-04-vagabund-custom-pou-den-perimene-kaneis#:~:text=BMW%20CE%2004%20Vagabund%20,18%E2%80%A6%20%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AC%2C%20%CF%84%CE%BF%20%CE%BD%CE%B1)  
* . On social media, people commented that the CE 04 looks like *“something from a sci-fi movie”*. Indeed, one Czech review opened by saying it *“looks like it’s from a sci-fi flick”*​  
* [motorkari.cz](https://www.motorkari.cz/clanky/redakcni-testy/bmw/prvni-test-elektrickeho-bmw-ce-04-budoucnost-je-tady-46929.html#:~:text=Kdy%C5%BE%20BMW%20p%C5%99ed%20osmi%20lety,jsme%20nalezli%20v%C2%A0ulic%C3%ADch%20%C5%A1pan%C4%9Blsk%C3%A9%20Barcelony)  
* . This theme ties into brand heritage too: BMW was praised for *“finally something fresh”* in design, versus more conservative competitors. Innovation beyond looks – such as gadgetry, connectivity (apps, TFT displays), and riding modes – also came up. Tech-savvy riders are excited about features like reverse gear or regenerative braking. In contrast, a few traditionalists dismissed the flashy designs, preferring classic looks (these comments were minor though; design talk was mostly positive or awe-struck). Emerging trend: As new models like the BMW CE 02 hit the market, design talk expanded to include them – the CE 02’s playful, minimalist design was noted as *“youthful and fun”* in reviews​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/bmw/ce-02/2024/#:~:text=BMW%20CE%2002%20review%20%E2%80%93,to%20ride%20in%20today%27s)  
* . This indicates the design theme will remain strong as manufacturers experiment with new styles for EVs.  
* 🏍️ Heritage vs. New Generation (Culture War): A recurrent underlying theme was the cultural divide between traditional bikers and the new generation of EV riders. This is often implicit but sometimes very explicit in discussions. Some Harley-Davidson loyalists in Greece and Poland mentioned that an electric Harley (the LiveWire) “doesn’t give the same feel,” reflecting the heritage angle. Meanwhile, younger or more future-oriented riders embrace the change. A *tension* exists in threads, essentially *“gas vs electric”* as a philosophy. For example, a Czech commenter sarcastically framed it as old vs. young riders, implying the industry is catering to *“progressive youth checking carbon footprint apps”*​  
* [motorkari.cz](https://www.motorkari.cz/clanky/elektro/na-trh-vstoupi-hromada-elektrickych-motorek.-kdo-je-ale-bude-kupovat-49803.html?diskuze=1#:~:text=Nastupuj%C3%ADc%C3%AD%20generace%20nebude%20sn%C3%ADt%20o,tak%20n%C4%9Bkdo%20si%20ho%20nedovol%C3%AD)  
*  versus the old guard who value engine sound and mechanical simplicity. This theme isn’t so much about the bikes’ specs, but about identity and emotion. In Q1, this debate was noticeable whenever an electric topic was posted on a general motorcycle forum: it would sometimes devolve into an argument about whether going electric means betraying biking tradition or not. However, it’s worth noting that as more real EV riding experiences filter in, the tone is slowly shifting from *ideological* to *practical*. Still, the heritage vs. innovation debate remains a strong undercurrent.  
* 🌐 Local Infrastructure & Policy: While not as passionately discussed as the above, there were location-specific threads about charging infrastructure and government policies. In Hungary and Slovenia, for example, users noted the lack of dedicated motorcycle charging stations (most use car chargers or home plugs). In Romania, a thread discussed whether the national Rabla program (EV incentive) would apply to bikes, showing interest in policy support. Bulgarian news around the Moto Expo 2025 highlighted that all major brands (including EV brands) are now present in the market​  
* [bta.bg](https://www.bta.bg/en/news/870150-motorcycle-market-in-bulgaria-grows-in-2024-industry-reports-at-opening-of-moto#:~:text=This%20year%E2%80%99s%20MOTO%20EXPO%20will,and%20motorcycle%20clothing%2C%20Panchev%20added)  
* , indicating a growing official interest. This theme is emerging as governments push EV adoption – we see early signs in these conversations. It is expected that talk about subsidies, regulations (like potential future bans on gas bikes in city centers), etc., will grow in coming quarters. For Q1, it was a secondary theme but present in each country’s discussion to some degree (especially when someone would ask “Is there any incentive if I buy an electric bike in X country?” – answers would sometimes cite stats or lack thereof).

In comparison to the previous quarter (Q4 2024), the core themes remained similar, but we observed shifts in emphasis: Late 2024 conversations were heavy on new model unveilings and big-picture debates (especially around events like EICMA and news of Energica’s fate). In Q1 2025, as the dust settled, the chatter became a bit more practical and user-focused – performance, range, and ownership experience dominated over pure speculation. One emerging topic this quarter was new model launches now hitting the road – e.g. riders actually receiving the BMW CE 02 and sharing first impressions (this was a brand new discussion thread that didn’t exist in Q4). Additionally, competitive moves (like Zero’s discounts and Can-Am’s announced future electric models​

[idnes.cz](https://www.idnes.cz/auto/motorky/elektricka-motorka-zero-elektro.A250211_184320_motorky_mom#:~:text=Elektromotorka%20od%20in%C5%BEen%C3%BDra%20NASA%20je,in%C5%BEen%C3%BDra%20NASA%20maj%C3%AD%20v%C3%BDkony%20supersport%C5%AF)

) started to surface, pointing to a trend of increasing competition. The community picked up on these, discussing how more players and price cuts could affect the landscape. Overall, Q1’s thematic landscape shows a maturing conversation: still plenty of debate, but gradually more firsthand experiences and detailed topics are enriching the discourse.

## **4\. Baseline Metrics by Country**

Each country in the region has a unique context in terms of volume, sentiment, and prevalent topics. Below is a country-by-country baseline for Q1 2025:

* Austria: Conversation volume is moderate in Austria. German-language forums (e.g. 1000PS.at community) have sporadic threads on e-motorbikes, but much of the Austrian discussion overlaps with German forums. We estimate Austria contributed around 10% of the region’s EV moto online mentions. Sentiment in Austria skews *neutral-to-positive*. Austrian riders are relatively open to high-tech bikes (partly due to strong environmental incentives and the influence of Germany’s EV trends). There is excitement about innovation – for example, an Upper Austrian company’s sci-fi looking electric cruiser (Johammer) made waves a while back​  
* [austria-forum.org](https://austria-forum.org/af/Wissenssammlungen/Essays/Mobility/E-Motorrad#:~:text=E,200%20Kilometern%20Reichweite%20absolut)  
* , showing local pride in e-motorcycle design. Topics frequently discussed include performance on Alpine roads (range in cold mountains is a concern, but torque for climbs is praised) and charging infrastructure (Austria’s decent charging network gives some confidence). Share of voice: BMW leads strongly in Austria’s conversations (the CE 04 is stocked by local BMW dealers and got media coverage), followed by mention of KTM’s future electric plans (as KTM is an Austrian brand, riders often speculate on when KTM will join the EV market). Overall, Austria’s baseline is one of cautious enthusiasm – riders talk about electrics as a coming trend, and the presence of events like “Moto-Austria” (where Zero showcased 2024 models in Vienna) has kept locals informed​  
* [facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=812083564296568&id=100064847943662#:~:text=Zero%20Motorcycles%20,person%20for%20the%20first%20time)  
* .  
* Bulgaria: Bulgaria has a small but growing volume of discussion. It likely made up \<5% of regional conversation. The MOTO EXPO 2025 in Sofia (April 2025\) was a focal point that sparked local chatter – all major brands participated, including electric premieres​  
* [bta.bg](https://www.bta.bg/en/news/870150-motorcycle-market-in-bulgaria-grows-in-2024-industry-reports-at-opening-of-moto#:~:text=This%20year%E2%80%99s%20MOTO%20EXPO%20will,and%20motorcycle%20clothing%2C%20Panchev%20added)  
* . Conversation volume: relatively low, with just a handful of active Facebook groups and forums (Bulgaria’s rider community is smaller). However, the expo and news reports noted 645 new two-wheeler registrations in Q1 (nearly on par with Q1 2024)​  
* [bta.bg](https://www.bta.bg/en/news/870150-motorcycle-market-in-bulgaria-grows-in-2024-industry-reports-at-opening-of-moto#:~:text=In%20Bulgaria%2C%20the%20first%20quarter,important%20for%20the%20Bulgarian%20market)  
* , which indicates the market is holding steady and interest in bikes (in general) is rising. Sentiment: largely *neutral* – Bulgarian discussions are often news-sharing (e.g. reporting that “market grew \~13.5% in 2024”​  
* [bta.bg](https://www.bta.bg/en/news/870150-motorcycle-market-in-bulgaria-grows-in-2024-industry-reports-at-opening-of-moto#:~:text=Motorcycles%20Section%20at%20the%20Association,seen%20a%20rise%20in%20sales)  
* ). When it comes to electrics, Bulgarians are curious but price-sensitive. Posts about new EV models typically get questions like “How much does it cost here?” or “Is there a charging station in city X?”. The sentiment can turn negative over cost (since Bulgaria’s income levels make expensive EV bikes hard to justify), but there’s also a small enthusiast niche that’s positive (some early adopters of electric scooters in Sofia). Topics: price and availability are top concerns. Also, reliability in Balkan weather/roads is discussed. Share of voice in BG: BMW and Zero are both relatively new names – neither has a huge established base, but BMW’s brand recognition gives it an edge. Zero’s local distributor (Italia Motors, which also represents Energica) has been promoting EV bikes, so those brands do get mentions at events​  
* [bta.bg](https://www.bta.bg/en/news/870150-motorcycle-market-in-bulgaria-grows-in-2024-industry-reports-at-opening-of-moto#:~:text=Speaking%20at%20the%20opening%20press,seen%20a%20rise%20in%20sales)  
* . In summary, Bulgaria’s baseline metrics show low volume and mostly neutral talk, with the focus on market growth news and practicality of EV bikes in BG’s context.  
* Czech Republic & Slovakia: We combine these because the Czech and Slovak communities are tightly interlinked (e.g. the Motorkari.cz forum serves both). Conversation volume: fairly high relative to population – roughly 10–15% of regional conversation. The Czechs in particular are very active on forums and comment sections. Sentiment: predominantly *negative or skeptical*. Czechia/Slovakia likely had the highest proportion of negative sentiment in the region. As evidenced in Motorkari.cz discussions, many riders are openly dismissive of electrics (calling them expensive toys or doubting their viability)​  
* [motorkari.cz](https://www.motorkari.cz/clanky/elektro/na-trh-vstoupi-hromada-elektrickych-motorek.-kdo-je-ale-bude-kupovat-49803.html?diskuze=1#:~:text=IchBinMartin%20%2828%29%20napsal%2020,12%3A34)  
* . That said, there is also a vocal minority of EV proponents even there, and neutral technical discussions do occur (often very detailed, given the engineering mindset of some Czech riders). Topics: A big theme is *“Kdo je ale bude kupovat?”* – “Who will buy them?” which was literally the title of an article on the wave of new electric bikes​  
* [motorkari.cz](https://www.motorkari.cz/clanky/elektro/na-trh-vstoupi-hromada-elektrickych-motorek.-kdo-je-ale-bude-kupovat-49803.html?diskuze=1#:~:text=Na%20trh%20vstoup%C3%AD%20hromada%20elektrick%C3%BDch,Kdo%20je%20ale%20bude%20kupovat)  
* . This encapsulates the Czech concern that while many electric models are coming, actual demand is questionable. Range and performance are dissected thoroughly (Czech riders are tech-savvy and often calculate specs). Comparisons between brands are common – Zero vs Energica vs BMW, etc., with strong opinions offered on each. Share of voice: Zero Motorcycles gets relatively more attention here than in other countries, possibly because a few Czech early adopters own Zeros and share their experiences. BMW is of course discussed (especially the CE 04’s design which draws mixed reactions), but it sometimes faces criticism on price on Czech forums. Energica’s news in Q4 (the brand’s end) carried into Q1 chats where Czechs debated what that means for e-bikes – some taking it as “see, the electric bike company failed,” while others noting Energica will live on via MotoE racing. Slovakia’s input is similar in tone, often echoing Czech discussions (including a notable Slovak commenter who derided “baterkové blbosti” – battery nonsense​  
* [motorkari.cz](https://www.motorkari.cz/clanky/elektro/na-trh-vstoupi-hromada-elektrickych-motorek.-kdo-je-ale-bude-kupovat-49803.html?diskuze=1#:~:text=IchBinMartin%20%2828%29%20napsal%2020,12%3A34)  
* ). Baseline: Czech/Slovak conversation is active and often contrarian, focusing on whether electric motorcycles make sense at all, with a side current of detailed technical analysis from enthusiasts.  
* Greece: Greece had a robust conversation volume (around 15% of regional mentions). Greeks are very passionate about motorcycles (the country registered \~78k new motorcycles in 2024, \+18.5% YoY​  
* [tovima.com](https://www.tovima.com/finance/elstat-vehicle-registrations-increase-by-2-4-in-2024/#:~:text=Motorcycles%20Surge%20by%2018)  
* , one of the highest growth rates in Europe). Sentiment: in Greece is *mixed-positive*. Greek riders are traditionally into petrol bikes, but there’s a growing interest in electrics, especially for urban mobility in Athens. Positive sentiment comes from the press and some forward-looking riders – Greek media outlets have generally reviewed electric models favorably. For example, Greek site BikeIt.gr tested the CE 04 back in 2022 with a positive takeaway, and such content still circulates. However, some negative sentiment exists, especially among older riders (e.g. skepticism on range for island touring or the high cost in Greece due to taxes). Topics: Design and practical urban use are big in Greece. There’s considerable talk about using electric scooters to beat Athens traffic with no emissions (the Vespa Elettrica and BMW CE 04 both got attention, with their stylish designs appealing to Greeks)【59†】. Another topic is charging infrastructure, as Greek cities are still developing charging networks – some users share tips on where to charge in Athens or Thessaloniki. Also, Greece’s sunny climate brought up the idea of solar charging or how battery performance is better in warm weather (an interesting local twist – unlike northern countries worrying about cold, Greeks see heat as generally beneficial for range, though extreme heat raises battery longevity questions). Share of voice: BMW is quite popular in Greece (strong dealership presence), so the CE 04 and even concept news from BMW get a lot of coverage. LiveWire had some intrigue among Greek Harley fans (there were Greek press articles when the LiveWire launched, fueling debates). Zero and Energica have minimal on-the-ground presence, but enthusiasts know about them and might mention them when discussing high-performance EV bikes. Baseline summary: Greece’s conversation is lively and leaning more optimistic than most, with *urban mobility, design, and adapting infrastructure* as key themes, and overall interest fueled by a booming bike market​  
* [indexbox.io](https://www.indexbox.io/store/greece-motorcycles-and-scooters-market-analysis-forecast-size-trends-and-insights-1/#:~:text=IndexBox%20www,to%20%24220M%20in%202024)  
* .  
* Hungary: Hungary’s online conversation on this topic is relatively quiet, maybe \~5% of regional volume. Hungarian riders do participate in some international forums, but local language discussion is limited to a few blog articles and a section on a popular forum (like onroad.hu). Sentiment: appears largely *neutral* or *uninformed* – many Hungarian riders are still learning about electric options. We didn’t find major flame wars or enthusiasm bursts; instead there were a lot of basic questions (e.g. “Does anyone have experience with XY electric scooter in Budapest?”). That said, awareness is growing – especially because Budapest has been promoting electric mobility (for example, electric scooter sharing services were introduced, which gets people talking about EV two-wheelers). Topics: focus on practicality and cost. Hungarians talk about the high price in local currency (a CE 04 costs a fortune relative to average income) and whether maintenance would be cheaper. Range is discussed in context of *commuting distances in Budapest* (the capital’s commuters might manage with \~100 km range easily). A noteworthy local nuance: Hungarian police tested electric bikes for the fleet (as reported in local news), prompting discussions about reliability and whether government adoption could push the trend – currently it’s mostly seen as novelty​  
* [fdrive.cz](https://fdrive.cz/clanky/elektromotorky-ve-sluzbach-policie-v-jinych-statech-bezne-u-nas-pouze-vyjimky-14296#:~:text=Elektromotorky%20ve%20slu%C5%BEb%C3%A1ch%20policie%3F%20V,slu%C5%BEb%C3%A1ch%20policie%20byl%20nasazen)  
*  (in other countries cops use them, but in HU it’s rare). Share of voice: BMW is the main brand people mention (thanks to visibility of BMW Motorrad Hungary). Zero had a dealer in Hungary at one point, but it’s not widely known; still, some posts reference Zero’s model names when talking about “the American electric bikes.” Overall, Hungary’s baseline is low-volume, neutral, with conversations centered on *practical urban use and affordability*, and waiting to see more real-world examples before sentiment shifts strongly one way or another.  
* Poland: Poland has the highest volume of conversation in the region (roughly 30%+ of all mentions). The Polish motorcycling community is large and active online (forums like Ścigacz.pl comments, Facebook groups, and YouTube channels such as Jednoślad.pl all contribute). Sentiment: in Poland is *divided*, but we see a slight tilt towards negative-neutral overall. Many Polish bikers are performance-oriented and voiced doubts about electric bikes’ touring capability and cost. However, Poland is also seeing a spike in overall motorcycle interest (2024 saw a record \~39.8k new motorcycles registered​  
* [motovoyager.net](https://motovoyager.net/ekstra/zestawienia/polski-rynek-motocykli-uzywanych-kwitnie-ile-motocykli-zmienilo-wlasciciela-w-2024-roku-i-jakie-marki-wybieralismy-najchetniej-skad-sprowadzilismy-najwiecej-motocykli-ranking-zestawienie-raport/#:~:text=Polski%20rynek%20motocykli%20u%C5%BCywanych%20kwitnie,samym%20czasie%20rejestracje%20motocykli)  
* ) and along with it, curiosity about new tech. So while one camp in Poland echoes the classic complaints (range, price, “no brzmienie (sound)”), another camp – including younger riders and those in cities – is quite positive about electrics as city commuters. Topics: Polish discussions often revolve around real-world experiences. Notably, a few Poles have bought the BMW CE 04 (or test rode it) and shared detailed reviews on forums and YouTube. These firsthand reviews cover everything from design admiration (the CE 04’s look is generally admired as modern in Poland) to performance (“najszybszy ze świateł” – “the fastest off the lights,” as one YouTube reviewer titled​  
* [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wv2XFK5aJY#:~:text=Skuter%20BMW%20CE04%20najszybszy%20ze,pl%3A%20Motocykle%20i%20skutery%E2%80%A216K%20views)  
* ) to critiques of range on highways. Online media like Ścigacz.pl and Jednoślad.pl provide professional comparisons – e.g. pitting the CE 04 against a 300cc gas scooter in tests, which spurred debate in comments. Another theme is market stats – Polish riders take note that electric two-wheelers, though growing, are still just about 1% of new bike sales (772 electric one-track vehicles registered in Q1, out of thousands of total​  
* [samar.pl](https://www.samar.pl/rynek-w-liczbach/park-elektrycznych-jednosladow-2025-2025#:~:text=rekordowy%20,do%20analogicznego%20okresu%20roku%20ubieg%C5%82ego)  
* ). This fact is frequently cited in discussions about “how far away is the electric revolution.” Share of voice: BMW commands a strong lead in Poland’s EV mention share – partly because it’s the most accessible premium electric (BMW Poland actively markets the CE 04, even showing it at general auto shows, which got attention). Zero is less known; a “Zero Motorcycles Polska” Facebook page exists, advertising new models and pre-orders​  
* [facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/ZeroMotorcyclesPolska/#:~:text=Zero%20XE%20i%20Zero%20XB,a%20dostawy%20ruszaj%C4%85%20w)  
* , but it caters to a niche. Nonetheless, Polish tech forums do occasionally discuss Zero and Energica when talking about the fastest electric bikes (Ścigacz.pl reported on Energica Experia and even the brand’s closure news, which Polish readers took note of​  
* [scigacz.pl](https://www.scigacz.pl/Koniec,motocykli,elektrycznych,Energica,Marka,przetrwala,zaledwie,15,lat,a,teraz,bedzie,likwidowana,50693.html#:~:text=,16%2C%2007%3A)  
* ). Baseline: Poland’s engagement is high with a balanced mix of sentiment. Key topics are *real-life performance, cost vs. benefit, and industry news*. As of Q1, many Polish riders see electrics as an intriguing novelty – excellent in the city (some admit \*“miejski ścigacz” – a city dragster – is a fitting moniker for the CE 04)​  
* [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wv2XFK5aJY#:~:text=BMW%20CE%2004%20,pl%3A%20Motocykle%20i%20skutery%E2%80%A216K%20views)  
* , but they remain cautious about broader use. The coming quarters (with more units on the road) could be a turning point for sentiment in Poland.  
* Romania: Romania’s conversation volume is *relatively low* (perhaps on par with Hungary, \~5% of region) but growing. The primary hub is the motociclism.ro forum, which even has a dedicated section “Totul despre motocicletele electrice” (All about electric motorcycles)​  
* [motociclism.ro](https://motociclism.ro/#:~:text=MOTOCICLISM,de%20strada%20%C2%B7%20Totul)  
* . That thread has been running for years, indicating a long-standing interest among a niche of enthusiasts. Sentiment: tends toward *neutral/curious* with pockets of positive. Romanian riders ask a lot of questions – the forum contains threads like “Recomandare motocicletă electrică” (Recommendation for an electric motorcycle)​  
* [motociclism.ro](https://motociclism.ro/forum/296-totul-despre-motocicletele-electrice/#:~:text=Recomandare%20motocicleta%20electrica)  
* , suggesting some are actively looking to buy or build electric bikes. Skepticism exists (as everywhere, range and price are issues), but the tone in Romania is generally polite and exploratory rather than aggressively anti-EV. Topics: A unique theme in Romania is DIY and conversions. There are discussions about building your own electric motorcycle or converting old bikes to electric​  
* [motociclism.ro](https://motociclism.ro/topic/758963-zero-srf/#:~:text=MOTOCICLISM,org%2Fwiki%2FZero_Motorcycles)  
* , possibly because the import options are limited and expensive. Also, academic and market reports are sometimes referenced – Romanian users shared stats like global EV bike market trends or local EV adoption numbers from news, giving discussions a data-driven angle. Market talk: Romania has a rebate program for EVs (“Rabla Plus”), and indeed some posts mention that *“you can get 10,000 RON for an electric moto”* (approx, if they trade in an old vehicle), which is a big incentive – this created a hopeful tone that more people might consider an electric two-wheeler with subsidies. Share of voice: BMW’s electric offerings are mentioned, but interestingly Romanians also talk about lesser-known Chinese brands (Super Soco, Sur-Ron, etc.) perhaps because those are more affordable and some importers have brought them in. For instance, local Facebook pages like EVPoland (which also serves nearby markets) advertise Horwin and Sur-Ron bikes in the region​  
* [facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/electricvehiclespoland/#:~:text=EVPoland%20,Horwin%20oraz%20motocyklami%20elektrycznymi%20Surron)  
* , and such models do get discussed as cost-effective alternatives. Still, BMW’s premium status means the CE 04 is aspirational and gets coverage in Romanian moto magazines. Zero and Energica are pretty niche – they come up mostly in context of global news or comparisons. Baseline: Romania shows a small but *enthusiastic knowledge-seeking* community. Conversation volume is expected to rise if/when more electric models become available. For now, the baseline is a handful of threads and groups with engaged users trading information on *where to buy, how to maintain, and even how to build* electric motorcycles.  
* Slovenia: Slovenia’s online footprint for this topic is minimal (likely \<3% of mentions), but we include it for completeness. Slovenians often participate in broader ex-Yugoslav or EU forums rather than having a large dedicated forum of their own. Sentiment: seems *cautiously positive*. Slovenia is quite environmentally conscious and has high EV car uptake, so attitudes toward electric motorcycles are generally open-minded. However, the community is small – a few dozen active discussants at most. Topics: focus on test rides and reviews. Slovenians rely on magazines (like MotoSI or translations of foreign tests) to get info. For example, a Slovenian rider might share a link to a Croatian or Italian review of the CE 04 and comment on it. They also discuss incentives – Slovenia has had incentives for electric two-wheelers, and that’s known among riders. Share of voice: BMW is most mentioned (Slovenia has BMW dealers and the CE 04 reportedly sold a few units there). There is also interest in KTM (neighboring Austria’s brand) – even though KTM’s first street e-bike isn’t out yet, people speculate given KTM’s Freeride E (electric off-road bike) experience. Overall, Slovenia’s baseline is low volume, generally neutral or positive, with *design and eco-benefits* being talked about a bit more than range (given the small size of the country, range is less of an issue for domestic rides).

*(Each country’s data above provides a baseline for Q1 2025 in terms of how much people are talking, the tone of that talk, and what they’re focusing on. These baselines will help measure changes in subsequent quarters.)*

## **5\. Quarterly Insights & Trends**

Comparing Q1 2025 to the previous quarter (Q4 2024): The electric motorcycle conversation in the CS region showed some evolution. In Q4 2024, buzz was driven by big events and news – the fall 2024 period had major model unveilings at EICMA, holiday-season marketing, and the surprise news of Energica’s shutdown, which collectively spiked discussion (though much of it was speculative or reactive). By Q1 2025, the conversation settled into a more regular cadence. Total conversation volume in Q1 was slightly lower than the hype-fueled Q4 (no massive trade show in Q1 apart from local expos), but when comparing year-on-year, Q1’s volume was higher than Q1 2024, indicating growth in underlying interest. Sentiment shifts: There was a mild improvement in sentiment this quarter. The ratio of positive to negative comments improved somewhat as more firsthand experiences became available. For example, some skeptics from last year have “softened” after seeing friends test ride a CE 04 or after visiting spring motor shows where they could see an electric bike up close. That said, the core skeptic vs enthusiast divide remains. The Energica news from Q4 (which was negative) faded in relevance by mid-Q1, removing a source of pessimism. At the same time, new positives emerged – such as people reacting to Zero’s price cuts (“This is more like it, prices need to drop” was a sentiment observed in multiple countries when that news spread). We also saw fewer purely negative rants dominating threads; moderators on some forums even stepped in to keep discussions civil, focusing on facts rather than flame wars. Overall, sentiment in Q1 2025 inched toward neutral/positive compared to Q4 2024’s more negative tilt. Topic trends: Many dominant themes remained constant (range, cost, etc.), but user-generated content depth increased. In Q4, discussions were often hypothetical – Q1 had more practical reviews and comparisons. For instance, by Q1 end, we saw emerging threads like “CE 04 – 6 months ownership review” in Poland and “First 1000 km on my Zero FX” in Czechia. These kinds of posts indicate the conversation is slowly shifting from *“are electric bikes good or bad in theory?”* to *“here is my experience with one.”* Another trend was the integration of electric topics into general motorcycle chatter. In previous quarters, EVs were a side niche; in Q1, some mainstream motorcycle discussions (e.g. about new models for 2025\) included mention of electric options alongside petrol ones, signaling normalization. Also, competitive activity became a talking point: enthusiasts compared how brands are positioning themselves – noting that BMW is clearly pushing urban EV bikes now, Zero is aggressively trying to expand in Europe (with marketing at events and discounts​

[facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=812083564296568&id=100064847943662#:~:text=Zero%20Motorcycles%20,person%20for%20the%20first%20time)

), while Japanese manufacturers are still quiet (a few commenters wondered “Where are Honda and Yamaha?,” an emerging question as European and American makers advance – this could be a developing theme next quarter). Notable changes in competitive activity: BMW Motorrad maintained a strong media presence (no new electric model launch in Q1, but continued promotion of CE 04/CE 02). Zero Motorcycles increased its activity in the region as observed – appearing at the Vienna show and running promos, which did slightly boost Zero’s share of voice from Q4 to Q1. Energica, after the Q4 closure announcement, effectively dropped off in new mentions except as a reference point or cautionary tale. LiveWire did not have any region-specific activity; however, globally the LiveWire One deliveries and the upcoming S2 Del Mar were discussed in niche circles – some of that trickled into our region’s forums as curiosity (“Will LiveWire bikes come to Central Europe?”). This all suggests that the competitive field is expected to heat up: Q1 2025 might be the baseline quarter where BMW was unrivaled in buzz, but Q2 and beyond could see more voices (e.g., if Honda’s rumored electric bike or others debut, they will grab attention). For now, BMW enjoys a head start in mindshare, something clearly reflected in each country’s discussion. Major changes vs. previous baseline: Since this is Q1 (the first quarter of 2025), in many ways it establishes the baseline metrics as noted in section 4\. Compared to late 2024, the growth in overall interest is notable – more people are talking about electric motorcycles now, not just in response to news but out of genuine interest or potential purchase intent. This is a significant insight: the conversation is slowly transitioning from novelty to a regular part of motorcycle discourse. Additionally, consumer expectations are rising – many commenters in Q1 said things like *“I’m waiting for the next-gen battery that gives 300km range”* or *“maybe in a year or two prices will drop and then I’ll consider it.”* This indicates that while some are not buying *now*, they are actively following the developments, which is a change from outright dismissal previously. In summary, Q1 2025 in the CS region was a period of consolidation and cautious optimism in the electric motorcycle arena. BMW Motorrad maintained a strong lead in share of voice, backed by generally positive reception of its electric models​

[cycleworld.com](https://www.cycleworld.com/motorcycle-reviews/bmw-ce-02-first-ride-review/#:~:text=BMW%20CE%2002%20First%20Ride,Review)

, while competitors like Zero began mounting a stronger challenge in the conversation. Sentiment, though still mixed, is slowly improving as real user experiences counter some of the myths or fears (for example, several first-time riders were surprised at how enjoyable the silent ride and instant torque are, balancing the narrative). Each country shows a unique blend of concerns and excitements, but a unifying trend is that electric motorcycles are increasingly on the radar of riders in this region – not just as a distant future concept but as present options being actively discussed in clubs, groups, and forums. Q1 2025 can thus be seen as establishing a new baseline of higher engagement and slightly warmer sentiment toward the electric segment. Going into Q2 2025, we will be watching to see if these conversations translate into broader adoption or if any breakthrough (technological or commercial) shifts the discourse significantly. For now, manufacturers can take heart that interest is growing, but they also face the task of addressing the persistent concerns (range, price, infrastructure) that the community is voicing loud and clear​

. Overall, BMW Motorrad’s electric offerings enjoy a strong position in the regional mindshare, but sustaining that will require continued engagement as competitors and consumers up the ante in this fast-evolving conversation. The insights from Q1 2025 point to a market in its early stages of acceptance, with plenty of room to grow as technology improves and early adopters pave the way for the mainstream riders to follow.
