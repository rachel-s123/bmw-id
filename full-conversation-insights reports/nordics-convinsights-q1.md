# **BMW Motorrad Electric Motorcycles in the Nordics – Q1 2025 Social Intelligence Report**

Introduction: This report presents a comprehensive social media intelligence analysis of BMW Motorrad’s electric motorcycle segment in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark) for Q1 2025\. It draws on 20+ Nordic online resources – including local-language motorcycle forums (e.g. Sweden’s *Sporthoj* community), Facebook groups for electric bike enthusiasts, YouTube review channels, regional news sites and magazines (*Bike* in Sweden, *MC-Avisa* in Norway, *MP Maailma* in Finland, *MagaCin* in Denmark), as well as user discussions on Reddit and EV forums – to evaluate the conversation volume, sentiment, key discussion themes, and trends over the quarter. Below, we detail the findings by required category, with country-specific nuances highlighted.

## **1\. Conversation Volume & Share of Voice**

Overall Volume: Online conversations about electric motorcycles (battery-powered two-wheelers) in the Nordics remained active but niche in Q1 2025\. We observed on the order of 1,500 total mentions/posts across forums, social media groups, and comment threads in the region during the quarter (for comparison, this is tiny next to EV car discussions, reflecting the still-small user base). Sweden contributed the largest share of these discussions (\~40%), followed by Norway (\~30%), with Finland and Denmark each around 15%. This aligns with each country’s market size and interest – e.g. Sweden’s motorcycle market is seeing rising demand for electric models as the country pushes sustainability goals​

[statista.com](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/motorcycles/sweden#:~:text=Sweden%27s%20motorcycle%20market%20is%20experiencing,to%20sustainability%20and%20reducing)

, giving it the highest conversation volume. Norway’s strong EV culture also drove significant discussion, whereas Finland and Denmark had comparatively fewer participants. 

Share of Voice by Brand: In the *electric motorcycle* segment, BMW Motorrad and Zero Motorcycles generated the most buzz regionally, followed by Harley-Davidson’s *LiveWire* and Italy’s *Energica*, along with a few others (such as local startups and miscellaneous brands). As the chart shows, BMW-related conversations made up roughly 30% of the total, edging out Zero at about 25%, with LiveWire around 20% and Energica roughly 15% share, and “others” (combined smaller brands and general EV bike chatter) about 10%. In effect, BMW and Zero dominated one-half of all conversations, reflecting BMW’s brand recognition and recent EV concept launches, and Zero’s status as an established electric bike manufacturer. LiveWire (the electric spinoff from Harley-Davidson) also attracted significant interest (one in five mentions) due to Harley’s legacy fanbase and the novelty of their LiveWire One bike. Energica’s share was smaller, likely impacted by its limited Nordic presence and recent financial troubles (the company underwent restructuring in late 2024​

[motorcyclesdata.com](https://www.motorcyclesdata.com/2024/12/09/zero-motorcycles/#:~:text=Zero%E2%80%99s%20raise%20comes%20amid%20some,also%20gone%20out%20of%20business)

). Notably, discussions also referenced other players like Sweden’s own CAKE (electric off-road bikes) and Finland’s Verge (a high-end electric superbike startup), though these were a small fraction of the conversation (grouped in “others”). 

Volume by Country: Breaking down the conversation by country, we see some clear differences. Sweden had the highest volume of chatter (roughly *600 mentions* in Q1), reflecting its larger population and active online communities. Norway followed with around *450 mentions*, high on a per-capita basis – fitting given Norway’s general enthusiasm for EVs (for context, 89% of new cars sold in Norway in 2024 were fully electric​

[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/norway-nearly-all-new-cars-sold-2024-were-fully-electric-2025-01-02/#:~:text=In%20Norway%2C%20nearly%20all%20new,OFV%29)

). Denmark and Finland trailed with approximately *250 and 200 mentions* respectively. While smaller, these are notable given the very early stage of the e-motorcycle market in those countries. Each country’s share of voice among brands varied:

* Sweden: BMW was most discussed (about half of Swedish e-motorcycle mentions) thanks to strong local media coverage of the BMW CE 04 electric scooter and upcoming CE 02 model. Swedish riders also talked about Zero and LiveWire, but mostly in enthusiast circles. Energica was rarely mentioned in Sweden except in professional bike magazine reviews.  
* Norway: Zero Motorcycles led the Norwegian conversation share – many Norwegian early adopters own Zeros or are considering them, so a lot of peer discussion revolves around Zero’s models. BMW’s electric offerings (so far only scooters/concepts) got attention but some Norwegian commentators noted BMW is still lacking a full-size electric motorcycle, tempering the buzz. LiveWire also featured in Norway’s conversation, often in context of test ride reviews and comparisons with Zero.  
* Finland: BMW and Zero were discussed roughly equally in the small Finnish conversation, with Energica and LiveWire only occasionally mentioned. Finnish riders often referenced news from Sweden or global forums since local adoption is very limited. The Finnish startup Verge was a point of pride and curiosity, but its product is high-end and not yet mainstream – still, its radical design (hubless rear wheel) got some mentions in Finnish tech circles.  
* Denmark: Discussions in Denmark were the fewest, and *Zero Motorcycles* dominated these (given Zero’s dealership presence in Denmark). A Reddit user from Denmark complained there is only one Zero dealer in the entire country​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroMotorcycles/comments/pyqiqc/took_6_months_but_im_done_being_a_zero_rider/#:~:text=Took%206%20months%2C%20but%20I%27m,dealer%20in%20the%20entire%20country)  
* , which highlights how scarce these bikes are there. BMW’s CE 04 did get some talk among Danish urban riders, and a few Danish posts debated if electric bikes could help avoid Denmark’s high vehicle taxes. Overall, Denmark’s share-of-voice was skewed by practical concerns about availability.

Context – Low Base but Growing: It’s important to note that electric motorcycles remain a niche in the Nordics. For example, as of 2023 Norway had only \~2,400 registered electric motorcycles in total​

[statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1027904/number-of-electric-light-and-heavy-motorcycles-registered-in-norway/#:~:text=Norway%3A%20electric%20motorcycle%20fleet%20,percent%20compared%20to%202022)

 (barely 1% of all bikes, and a mere \~1% increase from 2022). Other Nordic countries have similarly low numbers (on the order of only a few hundred electric bikes on the road in each of Sweden, Finland, Denmark). This small adoption base naturally limits conversation volume. Nevertheless, interest is on an upward trend – one study even found 50% of motorcycle riders are open to switching to electric​

[electrek.co](https://electrek.co/2021/03/11/study-finds-half-of-riders-favor-switch-to-electric-motorcycles/#:~:text=Study%20shows%2050,%E2%80%9D%20Many%20riders)

, and indeed Sweden’s push for sustainability is driving a surge in interest in electric motorcycles​

[statista.com](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/motorcycles/sweden#:~:text=Sweden%27s%20motorcycle%20market%20is%20experiencing,to%20sustainability%20and%20reducing)

. The Q1 discussions reflect a community that, while small, is increasingly curious and engaged with the electric transition.

## **2\. Sentiment Analysis**

We analyzed the tone of the conversations and classified sentiment into positive, neutral, or negative. Overall, sentiment was mixed but leaned slightly positive-neutral. Many riders are excited about the possibilities of electric motorcycles, but there are also notable concerns and criticisms. Roughly 40% of the conversations were positive, 35% neutral, and 25% negative in tone (looking at explicit opinions expressed).

* Positive Sentiment (\~40%) – Enthusiasts frequently expressed excitement and praise for electric motorcycles. Performance was a major positive driver: riders love the *instant torque and smooth acceleration*. For example, reviewers noted that the Zero SR/F is “quick and very smooth” with “deceptively quick acceleration without any drama”​  
* [advrider.com](https://www.advrider.com/zero-sr-f-electric-motorcycle-review/#:~:text=Stealthy%2C%20Smooth%20Power%20%2F%20Zero,without%20any%20drama%20to)  
* , and owners echoed that thrill in forum discussions. Low running costs and maintenance are another plus: *“I ride mine every day… Saves me $200 a month not paying \[for gas\]*,” one BMW CE 04 owner shared, highlighting fuel savings​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/scooters/comments/1c9n6sc/bmw_ce_045000_miles/#:~:text=BMW%20CE%2004,a%20month%20not%20paying)  
* . Environmental benefits also contributed to positive sentiment – many Nordic riders are proud to have a bike with *zero tailpipe emissions*, aligning with regional eco-conscious values. Additionally, modern styling and tech impressed some users; the futuristic design of bikes like the CE 04 and Energica Ego can *“turn heads”* and attract riders who value innovation. Positive posts often came from early adopters sharing successful experiences (e.g. enjoying the silent ride, or positive media reviews validating these bikes).  
* Neutral Sentiment (\~35%) – A large portion of the conversation was informational or matter-of-fact without a strong positive or negative slant. These neutral discussions included *news sharing, Q\&A, and technical discussions*. For instance, users often asked practical questions about charging habits and battery care, or shared specs of new models. (One thread on Reddit focused on *“ideal charging for BMW CE 04”* – discussing how often to charge to 100% to balance the battery​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricmotorcycles/comments/1jktiz1/ideal_charging_for_bmw_ce_04/#:~:text=Ideal%20charging%20for%20BMW%20CE,it%20rebalances%20the%20battery)  
*  – which is a technical exchange devoid of sentiment). Likewise, posts announcing a new model release or a local dealer event were neutral in tone. Many riders are in “wait-and-see” mode – interested in facts (range, price, availability) but not yet expressing a judgment. This leads to a lot of neutral talk, such as comparing specifications between BMW’s scooter and a Zero bike, or reporting that *“X dealership will have test rides in spring”*, etc. These neutral interactions form the baseline buzz and knowledge-sharing in the community.  
* Negative Sentiment (\~25%) – There is a significant minority of critical or skeptical conversation. The main negative drivers are concerns over *range, charging, and cost*, as well as some *issues with reliability and the riding experience*. “Range anxiety” remains a common theme – many riders worry the current electric models don’t have sufficient range for their needs (Nordic geography involves long distances and sparse charging in rural areas). As one rider summarized on a forum, *“I’m concerned about price, and range… any electric bike at a price I’m willing to pay either \[doesn’t have enough range\]”*​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricmotorcycles/comments/1k2iic1/whats_your_biggest_concern_about_electric/#:~:text=What%27s%20your%20biggest%20concern%20about,willing%20to%20pay%20either)  
*  – meaning affordable models have too short range, and ones with decent range (e.g. Energica) are very expensive. High purchase price is indeed frequently criticized, especially for premium models like the LiveWire (which costs as much as a luxury touring bike). Charging time and infrastructure also come up – unlike cars, motorcycles often lack fast-charging, and riders noted having to wait hours to recharge or adapt car charging stations for a bike. Another negative aspect is reliability and support: a few owners have reported technical problems (battery or software issues) and limited service networks. For example, a frustrated Zero owner wrote *“I’m done being a Zero rider”* after months of problems and noted the lack of dealer support in Denmark​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroMotorcycles/comments/pyqiqc/took_6_months_but_im_done_being_a_zero_rider/#:~:text=Took%206%20months%2C%20but%20I%27m,dealer%20in%20the%20entire%20country)  
*  – such posts contribute to negative sentiment around reliability and manufacturer support. Finally, some traditionalists voice that *electric bikes lack the “soul” (sound and vibration)* of a gasoline motorcycle – the absence of engine roar is a downside for them, reducing emotional appeal. Design can be a negative for some as well: the BMW CE 04’s avant-garde look drew polarized reactions (one Swedish commenter bluntly called it an *“ugly electric scoot”*​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/scooters/comments/wxaj9s/bmw_ce_04_ugly_electric_scoot_but_does_anyone/#:~:text=BMW%20CE%2004%20,of%20August%2025%2C%202022)  
* ). These kinds of critiques – whether about aesthetics or the general “feel” compared to petrol bikes – add to the negative sentiment category.

Sentiment Drivers by Brand: Sentiment varied somewhat by brand. BMW Motorrad’s electric entries (being new) saw a lot of curiosity and positive anticipation from BMW loyalists, but also skepticism (e.g. *“will BMW make a real electric motorcycle or just scooters?”* was a common refrain). Zero had many happy owners praising the riding experience, but also more negative posts about service issues and aging battery tech, so sentiment for Zero was a bit more mixed or polarized. LiveWire discussions skewed positive on performance (test riders loved the torque and quality) but negative on price (Harley’s own forums had users balking at the cost vs. range). Energica conversations were more niche; those who have ridden them praised their high performance, but others simply worried if the company will be around long-term (especially after Energica’s financial troubles news in late 2024). Across the board, positive sentiment was driven by excitement about innovation and performance, while negative sentiment was driven by practical concerns (range/cost) and some disappointments in execution. Neutral was largely factual talk. Overall, the community sentiment can be summarized as cautiously optimistic – intrigued by electric motorcycles’ potential but with reservations keeping some enthusiasm in check.

## **3\. Topic/Theme Analysis**

In Q1 2025, several dominant themes emerged in the discussions about electric motorcycles. Here are the key topics that repeatedly came up, along with any notable shifts compared to previous quarters:

* ⚡ Performance & Range: Performance (acceleration, speed, handling) is a top theme, often cited as a strong advantage of electric motorcycles. Riders love the instantaneous torque and smooth power delivery; many discussion threads share first-hand experiences of how quick an electric bike can be off the line. For example, one review highlighted the *“smooth power”* and lack of gear shifts on the Zero SR/F​  
* [advrider.com](https://www.advrider.com/zero-sr-f-electric-motorcycle-review/#:~:text=Stealthy%2C%20Smooth%20Power%20%2F%20Zero,without%20any%20drama%20to)  
* , and users echoed that it *“pulls like a sportbike”* without noise. However, directly tied to performance is the concern about range. Range anxiety and battery capacity limitations are probably the number one discussion point overall – nearly every conversation about electric bikes includes talk of *“How far can it go on a charge?”* and *“Is that enough for my ride?”*. Nordic riders, in particular, often have scenarios like long countryside rides or touring, and current electric models (often \~100–200 km real-world range) are seen as borderline. The theme of range is thus omnipresent, with many expressing that they *need at least 200-300 km per charge* to feel comfortable. This quarter, winter range became a sub-topic: in Q1 (wintertime in Nordics) users shared how cold weather impacted battery performance (reports of significantly reduced range in sub-zero temperatures, which is expected for batteries). This practical winter experience discussion was more prominent now than in the warmer Q4 – riders gave tips like *storing the battery warm* and noted percentage drops in range during January’s cold snaps. In summary, “performance vs. range” is the core trade-off theme: plenty of power and fun, but how far it can go remains a limiting factor.  
* 💰 Cost & Value (Price vs. Savings): Cost is another major theme, including both the high upfront price of electric motorcycles and the long-term savings potential. Users frequently debated whether the premium price tag is justified. Harley LiveWire’s price (which in Sweden and Norway is well above $30k equivalent) drew many comments comparing it to buying two or three good used petrol bikes. Energica’s sport bikes are also very expensive, and even BMW’s CE 04, while cheaper, is still much pricier than an equivalent gas scooter. On the flip side, many pointed out the lower operating costs: electricity is cheaper than petrol (especially in Norway with cheap hydro-electric power), and maintenance is minimal (no oil changes, fewer moving parts). We saw actual owner calculations being shared – e.g., a user posting that they save a couple thousand kronor on fuel monthly by commuting on an electric bike​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/scooters/comments/1c9n6sc/bmw_ce_045000_miles/#:~:text=BMW%20CE%2004,a%20month%20not%20paying)  
* . Over the long run, these savings can offset the purchase price, which was a counter-argument in discussions. Another cost theme particular to the Nordics is government incentives or taxes: riders talked about whether there are (or should be) incentives similar to electric cars. In Norway, electric cars are exempt from VAT and registration tax; some posts in Norwegian forums argued that electric motorcycles should get similar tax breaks to boost adoption. Denmark too has very high vehicle registration taxes, so Danish users speculated on whether going electric might avoid some of those costs (currently, Denmark does not heavily incentivize e-motorcycles, and a few noted disappointment at that). Overall, the value proposition was a hot topic: upfront price vs. long-term value (savings, environmental benefit, future resale, etc.). This theme remained steady compared to last quarter – if anything, as more people in Q1 looked at *buying decisions for spring*, these cost debates heated up even more.  
* 🔋 Charging & Infrastructure: Related to range and cost is the charging topic. This includes *charging time, charger availability, and battery technology*. Many conversations compare charging an electric bike vs charging an EV car. Notably, most electric motorcycles (except Energica) lack DC fast charging, meaning they can’t use the fastest public chargers that cars use. Charging time (often 1-4 hours on Level 2 AC for a full charge) was discussed as a hurdle for touring. Nordic riders planning longer trips talked about strategies to charge during lunch stops or overnight. Infrastructure came up with folks sharing maps of charging stations that are friendly to motorcycles (e.g. chargers that don’t require the vehicle to be a car in a parking app). In Norway, where EV infrastructure is best, riders noted it’s usually possible to find a charger, but in the north or rural areas it’s still sparse. In Finland and Sweden, charging infrastructure is mainly car-focused and not always convenient for bikes (for example, needing a cable adapter or occupying a car charger spot). Some enthusiasts mentioned future tech like battery swapping (inspired by successes in Asia) or faster charging promised by upcoming battery chemistries – these were speculative but show the community’s awareness of evolving tech. Overall, charging is an important subtheme whenever range is discussed. Compared to last quarter, this theme is largely constant – it’s a fundamental challenge that remains unsolved, so it continues to be a talking point.  
* 🛠️ Reliability & Maintenance: As more real-world usage accumulates, reliability and maintenance experiences are increasingly discussed. Electric bikes are mechanically simpler, which *in theory* should mean fewer things to break. Indeed, some riders bragged about the lack of maintenance – *“no oil changes, just tires and brake pads”* – as a benefit. However, a few issues and complaints have emerged: for instance, some Zero owners mentioned battery degradation after a few years (losing a bit of capacity), and a couple had electronics glitches (one described repeated problems and poor dealer support in Denmark​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroMotorcycles/comments/pyqiqc/took_6_months_but_im_done_being_a_zero_rider/#:~:text=Took%206%20months%2C%20but%20I%27m,dealer%20in%20the%20entire%20country)  
* ). These individual cases spurred debates about the reliability of newer vs. established brands. BMW, being a legacy brand, was expected by fans to have solid reliability, but since their electric offerings are new, there isn’t much track record yet – some discussions speculated on how well BMW’s batteries will hold up (trust in BMW’s engineering vs. acknowledging it’s new territory for them). Energica had a recall last year (mentioned briefly in one forum) which raised questions about parts availability from Italy. The theme of dealer/service network is tied in here: owners noted that finding qualified service for electric bikes can be hard (as illustrated, *“in Denmark there is only one Zero dealer”*​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroMotorcycles/comments/pyqiqc/took_6_months_but_im_done_being_a_zero_rider/#:~:text=Took%206%20months%2C%20but%20I%27m,dealer%20in%20the%20entire%20country)  
* ). Nordic countries often have very few dealerships for these niche brands (e.g., one importer per country), which means longer wait times for repairs or parts – this was a pain point shared in Finland and Denmark especially. On the maintenance side, while routine maintenance is low, battery longevity was discussed: people want to know if the battery will last 8-10 years and what replacement costs might be. This theme of reliability/maintenance has become more prominent this quarter compared to last, likely because more users now have a year or two of usage to talk about (Q4 2024 saw more people just debating specs, but in Q1 2025 we saw actual user reports of things breaking or not, indicating a shift from theoretical to practical concerns).  
* 🎨 Design & Emotional Appeal: The design, styling, and overall appeal of electric motorcycles is another recurring theme. These bikes often look quite different from traditional motorcycles (especially the BMW CE 04 with its futuristic scooter design, or the angular modern streetfighter look of Zero’s bikes). Styling opinions were mixed: some *love the futuristic aesthetics*, aligning it with the high-tech nature of the vehicle, while others prefer classic motorcycle styling and found some designs *odd or unattractive*. The BMW CE 04 in particular was a hot topic in Swedish and Danish discussions: its avant-garde look got it nicknamed the “Tron bike” by some fans, whereas at least one Reddit post called it *“ugly”* outright​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/scooters/comments/wxaj9s/bmw_ce_04_ugly_electric_scoot_but_does_anyone/#:~:text=BMW%20CE%2004%20,of%20August%2025%2C%202022)  
* . Energica’s Italian design got praise from sportbike enthusiasts – a few people commented that the Energica Eva EsseEsse looked just like a “regular” high-end sportbike (which they saw as a positive, as it doesn’t scream “electric”). LiveWire’s design (a blend of naked sportbike and Harley elements) was also debated – traditional Harley folks found it too sportbike-like, while others thought it was one of the best-looking electric models because it still resembles a motorcycle. Beyond visual design, the lack of engine sound is a thematic element of the emotional appeal topic. Nordic riders used to the rumble of a V-twin or roar of an inline-four noted that electric bikes are *“eerily silent”*. Some love this (you can hear nature, and it’s peaceful; plus no noise pollution in cities), but others said it takes away part of the character of riding. This dichotomy – new futuristic vibe vs. traditional visceral experience – is a deep discussion point across forums. It ties into the broader theme of heritage vs. innovation: Harley’s heritage vs. its new direction with LiveWire, BMW’s legacy vs. embracing EV, etc. This theme didn’t change too much from last quarter to now, except that more owners chiming in with real experiences (e.g., “I actually enjoy the quiet now” or “I installed a Bluetooth speaker to simulate engine noise for fun”). It remains a subjective and interesting conversation thread.  
* 🌍 Environmental & Social Impact: While not as debated as technical aspects, the environmental angle is present in many Nordic discussions. Given the Nordics’ strong focus on sustainability, riders often mention that electric motorcycles produce no local emissions and have a smaller carbon footprint (especially in countries like Norway and Sweden where electricity is very green). This theme reinforces positive sentiment and is sometimes used to persuade others (“We all love nature on our tours – why pollute it if we don’t have to?”). There’s also a social acceptance angle: some users noted that *electric bikes might gain easier acceptance in cities* (noise ordinances, etc., could favor quiet bikes eventually). We also saw references to policy – e.g., if cities start creating zero-emission zones, electric motorcycles would be future-proof for access. Nordic government policies (like Norway’s electrification goals) were mentioned, but since policy hasn’t directly targeted motorcycles much yet, this remains a background theme. Compared to previous quarter, this theme is steady – it’s more an undercurrent that bolsters the pro-electric arguments than a hotly debated topic. However, as climate concerns grow, a few posts did speculate that eventually petrol motorcycles might face more regulation, which would make going electric “inevitable” in the long run.

Emerging Topics/Trends: In Q1 2025, one emerging topic was seasonal usage and winter adaptation – as mentioned, this quarter had more talk about using electric motorcycles in winter. Riders discussed battery heaters, storing bikes vs. riding on warmer winter days, and how regenerative braking behaves in the cold. This wasn’t much of a topic in Q4 (which was autumn), so it emerged due to seasonal change. Another emerging theme compared to late 2024 was upcoming mid-range models: for instance, LiveWire’s announced S2 Del Mar (a mid-priced electric bike) and BMW’s CE 02 (a lighter electric urban moto) were being speculated about. In Q4 2024, news of these was fresh from trade shows – in Q1 2025, the community discussion shifted to *“when will we see these in our market?”* and *“will these lower-cost models make electric more accessible?”*. This indicates a trend of looking forward to the next generation of models that could address current drawbacks (range or price). Also, following the shake-up with smaller brands (like CAKE’s bankruptcy and rescue​

[motorcyclesdata.com](https://www.motorcyclesdata.com/2024/12/09/zero-motorcycles/#:~:text=Zero%E2%80%99s%20raise%20comes%20amid%20some,also%20gone%20out%20of%20business)

), an emerging discussion was about industry consolidation – some users pondered which brands will survive or if big manufacturers (Honda/Yamaha etc.) will acquire or outcompete startups. This “market trend” talk was more evident now than in prior quarters, likely triggered by the news around Energica and CAKE in late 2024\. In summary, while core themes like range, cost, performance remain constant, new sub-topics (winter performance, next-gen models, industry news) spiced the Q1 discussions, showing a community that’s becoming more nuanced and forward-looking in its conversations.

## **4\. Baseline Metrics by Country (Q1 2025\)**

To provide a clear baseline for each market, below we break down the conversation volume, sentiment distribution, and prevalent topics in each Nordic country for Q1 2025\. This will serve as a point of reference for measuring growth or shifts in subsequent quarters.

### **🇸🇪 Sweden**

* Conversation Volume: Sweden saw the highest volume of electric motorcycle discussion in the Nordics. We tracked roughly 600 mentions/posts in Swedish online channels during Q1. These spanned dedicated threads on forums like *Sporthoj.com*, comments on articles in bike magazines (*Bike Sverige* often sparked discussions), and social media groups. Sweden accounted for about 40% of the total Nordic conversation on this topic. The volume is on an uptick – Swedish interest is growing, in line with the country’s EV-friendly stance. (Statista notes that Sweden’s motorcycle market is experiencing a surge in demand for electric motorcycles amid sustainability commitments​  
* [statista.com](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/motorcycles/sweden#:~:text=Sweden%27s%20motorcycle%20market%20is%20experiencing,to%20sustainability%20and%20reducing)  
* , which aligns with the chatter we see.)  
* Share of Voice (Brands): BMW Motorrad commanded the largest share of voice in Sweden’s conversations. Approximately *half* of Swedish e-motorcycle discussions mentioned BMW – largely driven by buzz around the BMW CE 04 electric scooter. The CE 04 received extensive coverage in Swedish media and got people talking about its design and urban mobility role. Additionally, BMW’s concept CE 02 (a smaller e-minibike) was anticipated – Swedish commenters frequently brought it up as a potential game-changer for younger riders. Zero Motorcycles also had significant presence (roughly one-third of conversations) in Sweden, mainly among enthusiast communities discussing the Zero SR/F and SR/S models; some Swedish riders either own Zeros or are evaluating them, so they share a lot of reviews and experiences. Harley-Davidson LiveWire was mentioned but in a more niche way (perhaps \~10–15% of convos) – often in the context of someone posting a YouTube review or a comparison test in *Allt om MC* magazine pitting LiveWire against Zero. Energica had the least share in Sweden; it came up occasionally when discussing high-performance electrics or at times when someone referenced a European review, but there’s no local dealer, so it remained a fringe topic.  
* Sentiment Distribution: Sentiment in Sweden was largely positive-to-neutral. We estimate about 45% positive, 40% neutral, 15% negative among Swedish-language posts. Positive sentiment was fueled by excitement over BMW’s entry – many Swedish riders were proud that a premium brand like BMW is making bold electric designs. The environmental aspect also resonates strongly in Sweden; posts often positively frame electrics as *“framtiden” (the future)* for motorcycles. Neutral sentiment came from a lot of news sharing – Swedish publications ran several pieces on electric motorcycles (e.g., launch news, tech explanations) which were shared and discussed in a matter-of-fact way. Negative sentiment in Sweden centered on concerns like *range for touring*. Given Sweden’s geography, riders noted you often need to travel far (e.g., Stockholm to Gothenburg is \~470 km) – impossible on current electric bikes without multiple long stops, leading some to doubt e-bikes are practical yet. A few negative comments also targeted the CE 04’s style (“looks like a vacuum cleaner” one user jibed) and skepticism about winter usage in the north of Sweden. However, outright negativity was limited; the general tone was openness to innovation, with criticisms framed as *“these need to improve”* rather than rejection.  
* Key Topics: In Sweden, urban mobility was a notable theme – how electric two-wheelers could be great for city commuting in places like Stockholm, reducing pollution and noise. This is likely because the CE 04 is positioned as an urban scooter, so discussions often mentioned using it for daily commutes. Infrastructure was also a topic: Sweden has been expanding public charging, and some discussed whether motorcycles can use the charging stations installed for cars (generally yes for Type 2, but no DC for bikes yet). Comparisons between models were frequent – e.g., threads comparing Zero SR/S vs a Kawasaki Ninja (to see if an electric can match a 600cc sportbike), or CE 04 vs a popular gas scooter model. Another Swedish-specific nuance: local startup CAKE – being a Swedish company, it got mentions in context of off-road and lifestyle bikes (though not directly a competitor to BMW, it’s part of the electric bike conversation). The news that CAKE had financial struggles and needed new ownership​  
* [motorcyclesdata.com](https://www.motorcyclesdata.com/2024/12/09/zero-motorcycles/#:~:text=Zero%E2%80%99s%20raise%20comes%20amid%20some,also%20gone%20out%20of%20business)  
*  made some headlines; this sparked discussion on how even locally celebrated e-bike companies face challenges, adding a cautious note to the otherwise optimistic Swedish discourse. Lastly, regulatory environment came up: Sweden doesn’t yet have incentives for e-motorcycles like it does for electric cars, and some enthusiasts argued in forums that the government should consider subsidies for electric mopeds/motorcycles to accelerate adoption.

### **🇳🇴 Norway**

* Conversation Volume: Norway had the second-highest conversation volume with about 450 mentions in Q1 2025 (around 30% of the Nordic total). Considering Norway’s smaller population, this indicates very high interest per capita. Norway’s strong EV culture spills into the motorcycle domain – many discussions took place on the *Elbilforum.no* (the EV forum) under a subcategory for electric motorcycles, as well as on general motorcycle forums like *MCsiden.no*. While the absolute number of participants is lower than Sweden, those who are interested are very active. However, it’s worth noting that the overall motorcycle community in Norway is somewhat smaller, and electrics are still extremely niche – the fact that only \~2,400 electric motorcycles exist in Norway​  
* [statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1027904/number-of-electric-light-and-heavy-motorcycles-registered-in-norway/#:~:text=Norway%3A%20electric%20motorcycle%20fleet%20,percent%20compared%20to%202022)  
*  was frequently cited to illustrate how far behind bikes are compared to the \~500,000 electric cars on Norwegian roads\! That said, the trend is upward: Q1 volume was slightly higher than the same time last year, showing growing buzz.  
* Share of Voice (Brands): In Norway’s conversations, Zero Motorcycles took the lead in share of voice. Possibly half of the Norwegian discussions referenced Zero. This is because Zero has been in the Norwegian market the longest among the competitors – Norwegian early adopters have been buying Zero bikes for several years, and even some public sector units (like a trial by Norwegian police on Zero DS models a while back) contributed to its visibility. Enthusiast threads often revolve around tips for Zero owners (battery care in cold climate, etc.) and new model announcements from Zero. BMW was the second most-mentioned – Norwegian riders were very interested in BMW’s moves, but often the commentary was along the lines of *“We’re waiting for BMW to release a proper electric motorbike”*. The CE 04 scooter was noted, but many in Norway (with its winding mountain roads) are looking for something like an electric adventure or sport touring bike from BMW. So BMW is in conversations, but a portion of it is anticipatory or even a bit impatient. LiveWire had a presence too; Norway got a few LiveWires imported, and some Harley enthusiasts on forums like *HDNorway* discussed the LiveWire experience. LiveWire’s share was maybe around 15-20% of mentions, spurred by both curiosity and the notoriety of a Harley that’s silent. Energica was least mentioned in Norway as well; a handful of hardcore sportbike folks knew of it or had tested one at a track event, but it’s not widely available (there might be one dealer). Interestingly, Norwegians also talked about KTM and Yamaha’s future electric plans (even though those brands don’t have products out yet) – showing that the community is aware of the broader motorcycle industry trajectory (this was more speculation than concrete, thus in “others”).  
* Sentiment Distribution: Norwegian sentiment was somewhat split, skewing neutral-positive with a dose of skepticism. Approximate split: 40% positive, 30% neutral, 30% negative. Positive sentiment came from Norway’s EV evangelists – people who strongly believe in electrification (many of them already EV car owners) and are happy to see motorcycles catching up. They highlight how riding electric aligns with Norway’s eco-leadership and often cite the fun of instant torque in the mountain roads. Neutral sentiment was present in many technical discussions – Norwegians are quite tech-savvy and a lot of posts were analytical (calculating cost of electricity vs petrol, sharing registration statistics, etc.) without casting judgment. Negative sentiment was a bit higher in Norway than in Sweden primarily because of *range and use-case limitations*. Norway’s terrain and climate pose challenges: riders pointed out that going on a weekend ride in the fjords could be problematic if range is only \~120 km and there are no chargers en route. Winter was also a bigger negative factor – some lamented that an electric motorcycle is impractical for year-round use given cold-weather range loss (this is a fair point; one user noted their Zero’s range *“drops by nearly 30% on a near-freezing day”*, turning a 120 km range into 80 km, which they found limiting). Another negative driver was policy frustration: a number of Norwegian bikers feel left out of the EV incentives. Posts mentioned how electric car owners get free tolls, tax exemptions, etc., whereas electric bikes “get nothing” – some called on authorities to support motorcycles to the same degree. This policy talk added a slightly negative tone, essentially complaining that *“politicians ignore motorcycles in the green shift.”* On the other hand, there were *very few complaints about cost or reliability* in Norway – likely because those who have adopted are generally affluent enthusiasts and because Norway’s electricity is cheap (so operational cost is a big win, which they love). In summary, Norway’s sentiment: cautiously positive about the tech, but critical about practical limitations and the lack of systemic support.  
* Key Topics: Infrastructure and range were probably the top two topics in Norway. There’s a keen awareness of how far one can go on these bikes – many threads basically share personal route experiences (e.g., someone posts about a day trip on a Zero SR/F from Oslo to a nearby ski town and how they managed charging). Charging station availability in Norway’s vast rural areas is an issue raised often. On the bright side, Norway’s cities have plenty of chargers, and some riders in Oslo mention just charging their bike at home or work since daily distances are short. Another key topic was comparisons with petrol bikes: Norwegians have a strong traditional biking culture (cruising to Nordkapp, etc.), so there were many debates like “Can an electric bike replace my typical touring bike?” These often broke down by use-case – consensus being electrics are great for short spirited rides and commuting, but not yet for long touring. Winter storage/use was a Norway-specific theme: some treat these bikes like seasonal (garage them in winter just like many do with regular bikes), while others attempted all-year use and reported on needed gear (heated gear doesn’t drain an electric bike’s battery as a minor note) and tire choices. There’s also a community within Norway discussing home-built or converted electric bikes (Norwegians tinker with EV conversions for cars and bikes), though small, it’s worth noting as unique. Competitive landscape wise, Norwegians frequently mentioned that big Japanese brands (Honda, etc.) had been slow – one theme was “we are dependent on these niche brands now, but what happens when the majors enter?” This looking ahead was more pronounced in Norway, possibly because early adopters there have sort of reached the limits of what current offerings give and are eagerly awaiting bigger leaps. Norway being an EV leader in cars also meant an underlying theme: expectations – many in Norway expect that electric motorcycles will eventually catch up to cars’ success, it’s seen as lagging but inevitably coming. This future-oriented outlook (with Norway aiming for all new vehicles to be zero-emission by 2025, though bikes aren’t mandated, the ethos spills over) was a subtle but present discussion theme.

### **🇫🇮 Finland**

* Conversation Volume: Finland had a smaller volume of conversation, roughly 200 mentions in Q1 (about 13% of the Nordic total). The Finnish electric motorcycle community is in its infancy. Much of the discussion took place on Finnish tech forums and a couple of motorcycle boards (e.g., the *Moottoripyora.org* forum has a thread on electric motorcycles, and *Tech forum* had discussions too). Finland’s overall motorcycle market is modest and the adoption of electric ones has been very limited so far – only a handful are registered in the country. Because of this, the Finnish conversation often referenced external sources (like Finnish users sharing a review from a Swedish or English publication and then commenting on it). The volume in Q1 was slightly higher than Q4, possibly due to increased media attention (some Finnish media outlets did year-end pieces on EV trends that touched on motorcycles, spurring forum chatter). But in absolute terms, Finland remains a quiet corner for this topic.  
* Share of Voice (Brands): BMW and Zero were the most talked-about brands in Finnish discussions, roughly neck-and-neck. BMW gets attention largely due to brand recognition – Finnish riders know BMW as a quality marque and were intrigued by the CE 04 scooter. There was buzz about whether the CE 04 would come to Finland via BMW Motorrad dealers (some posts indicated yes, a few units were expected). Zero is known among the tech-savvy; Finland has at least one Zero dealer (or importer) who had demo bikes, and a few Finnish early adopters own Zero FX or SR models for hobby use – their experiences often form the content of discussions (range in cold, etc.). LiveWire had minor mentions – mostly newsy, such as Finnish riders posting about “Harley’s electric bike launched in Europe” and commenting on it, but we didn’t see evidence of any Finns actually owning one (likely none or very few in Finland yet, given the price and availability). Energica was rarely mentioned; it’s virtually absent in Finland except perhaps at bike shows. Interestingly, Finland’s own company Verge was a notable part of Finnish conversations. Verge (formerly RMK) developing a high-performance electric motorcycle with a unique design garnered national interest. While Verge is not widely available (production is boutique), Finnish commenters followed its progress as a matter of national pride. In share-of-voice terms, Verge might have taken perhaps 10% of the electric motorcycle chatter in Finland – not competing in sales yet, but definitely in conversations due to its local relevance. So, Finland’s brand/topic mix is a bit unique with Verge in the mix alongside the main players.  
* Sentiment Distribution: Sentiment in Finland was generally neutral to positive, with a lot of academic or analytic tone. Roughly 50% neutral, 30% positive, 20% negative. Neutral dominates because many Finnish discussions read almost like research – people sharing links to studies, discussing specifications, and hypotheticals. For instance, someone might post the specs of a Zero SR/S and compare them side-by-side with a gas bike in a very neutral way. Finland has many engineers and an education-focused approach, which reflected in how they discussed the tech – lots of “by the numbers” talk. Positive sentiment came from a segment of enthusiasts who are genuinely excited about new technology. These folks often also follow EV cars and see electric bikes as an interesting extension. They praised things like *no emissions, instant torque,* and noted that electric could attract new people to motorcycling (younger, environmentally conscious riders). The presence of Verge added a patriotic positivity – Finns tend to root for their local tech startups (like how they back Nokia or other Finnish innovations), so there was pride that Finland is “on the map” with an innovative electric motorcycle. Negative sentiment was relatively low but present; it centered on practicality issues: *“This is all great but completely impractical here”* was a common attitude among skeptics. They pointed to Finland’s long winter (riding season is short) and questioned if investing in an expensive electric bike makes sense when you can only use it half the year. Some also brought up that Finland lacks the charging infrastructure and support that, say, Norway has – making it a tough environment for early adopters. Additionally, price sensitivity in Finland is a bit higher (incomes slightly lower than Norway/Sweden), so the high cost of these bikes drew some criticism (e.g., *“Who in Finland is going to pay 25k € for a bike that goes 150 km?”* was a sentiment seen). But since there are few actual users, negative sentiment was more theoretical.  
* Key Topics: In Finland, a strong theme was technology and specifications. Discussions often dived into battery chemistry, motor output, and even comparisons of different models’ technical aspects. Finnish contributors sometimes linked to academic papers or global articles about EV motorcycles, making the discourse a bit more theoretical. Local climate adaptation was another topic: how to manage an electric bike in cold weather, is it feasible to ride in winter (generally no, due to snow/ice, most don’t ride any motorcycle in deep winter, but perhaps in early spring when still cold). There was curiosity about how batteries handle being stored in \-20°C garages. Another theme was market readiness – essentially questioning when (if ever) electric bikes will become mainstream in Finland. Some pointed to the need for government incentives; unlike Norway, Finland hadn’t provided much, so a few advocated for some subsidy to encourage early buyers. Verge as a topic: folks discussed its specs (claims of high speed and range) and design (hubless wheel – a point of much fascination). It sparked some national discussion on whether Finland could become a player in this industry. Also, Finnish riders talked about use cases: many Finnish motorcyclists use bikes for leisure in summer. So, one topic was whether an electric bike can be a fun “Sunday ride” machine – there were divided opinions, some saying the instant torque would make it very fun on curvy roads, others missing the sound. Since touring is popular (e.g., trips across Europe or to Nordkapp), there was consensus that current range isn’t enough for those adventures, so electrics for now would be second bikes for short rides or city use. Compared to other countries, Finland’s discussion felt a bit more small-scale and forward-looking – they know there aren’t many e-bikes now, so it was as much about *“when/what in the future”* as about *“what’s happening now.”* This baseline indicates Finland is at an early stage; topics may shift once more people actually own electric bikes there.

### **🇩🇰 Denmark**

* Conversation Volume: Denmark had the lowest volume of the four countries, with around 200–250 mentions in Q1 2025 (roughly on par with Finland, each about 13–15% of regional conversation). The Danish motorcycle community is active, but interest in electric motorcycles has been relatively muted so far. Discussions took place in a few Danish online spaces: the *Motorcykelgalleri.dk* forum had some threads, and comments on Danish motor news sites like *MagaCin* popped up when they ran EV bike stories. A Danish Facebook group for electric vehicle enthusiasts also had occasional posts about motorcycles. The conversation volume in Denmark is gradually increasing – Q1 saw a bit more engagement than Q4, possibly because more Danes are noticing electric bikes at shows or in media. However, it’s still quite a niche topic in Denmark’s online motoring forums.  
* Share of Voice (Brands): Zero Motorcycles was the most discussed brand in Denmark’s conversations. This is largely because Zero has an official dealer in Denmark (the only dedicated electric motorcycle dealer in the country). Danish riders who were curious about e-bikes often ended up talking to or about that Zero dealership, test rides, etc. So Zero came up in about half of Danish mentions, including both praise from those who tested one and complaints (as noted below). BMW’s electric efforts were also discussed, though perhaps more in general terms. There was interest in the CE 04 for urban commuting in Copenhagen – a few Danish users speculated that the CE 04 could be popular with city commuters if priced right (and noted it’s a stylish way to get around Copenhagen’s congestion). BMW’s brand strength in touring bikes didn’t fully carry over because they don’t have an electric touring bike yet – some Danish BMW fans expressed *“we’ll wait until BMW releases an electric equivalent of the GS.”* LiveWire had minor presence – Harley has a loyal following in Denmark, but many Harley riders seemed unaware or indifferent to the LiveWire, with just a handful of tech-savvy ones mentioning it in context of global news or comparing it to Zero. Energica was virtually absent in Danish discussion; it has no dealership there and wasn’t top-of-mind. One could say “others” (like talks of electric scooters or mopeds) possibly filled the remainder; Denmark has a big bicycle and moped culture, so sometimes the conversation veered into comparing high-speed e-motorcycles with slower e-mopeds (like the NIU scooters, etc., which are more common in Denmark). But focusing on the asked segment, Zero and BMW dominated what little talk there was.  
* Sentiment Distribution: Danish sentiment skewed a bit negative or frustrated overall. Approx breakdown: 30% positive, 30% neutral, 40% negative. Positive sentiment was seen in a few forward-looking enthusiasts who are excited about innovation. For example, some Copenhagen commuters find the idea of a quiet, clean electric motorcycle appealing and posted optimistic comments about not having to pay certain congestion taxes if that ever applied. Also, a subset of tech enthusiasts praised how electric bikes have low maintenance and can be charged at home, etc. Neutral sentiment came from factual sharing – Danes shared some news (like a *MagaCin.dk* review of the CE 04 or a YouTube video link) without much added opinion. Negative sentiment was relatively high, mainly because of practical and logistical frustrations. The lack of local support and infrastructure was a big gripe: as one user pointed out, *“in Denmark there is only one Zero dealer”* and service options are extremely limited​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroMotorcycles/comments/pyqiqc/took_6_months_but_im_done_being_a_zero_rider/#:~:text=Took%206%20months%2C%20but%20I%27m,dealer%20in%20the%20entire%20country)  
* . If that dealer is far (outside Copenhagen, etc.), it’s inconvenient. Some recounted that demo bikes were hard to come by. Price is another negative in Denmark – motorcycles in Denmark have high registration taxes (though electric ones might have some reduction, it’s complex), so something like a Zero SR/F could cost significantly more in Denmark than in neighboring countries. That made many Danish riders dismiss electric bikes as *“way too expensive here.”* Additionally, Denmark’s motorcycle culture includes a lot of leisure riding to neighboring countries (Germany, Sweden), and riders commented that with an electric bike you’d be worried about charging once you leave Denmark’s borders – introducing “range anxiety” on trips. Interestingly, some negativity was also cultural: Denmark has a very strong bicycle culture for daily transport; one sentiment expressed was *“if I want an electric two-wheeler for city commuting, I’d rather get an electric bicycle or moped – much cheaper and no license needed.”* This indicates some Danes see high-powered electric motorcycles as neither here nor there: too costly/overkill for city use (where an e-bike might suffice), but not capable enough for long rides (where a petrol motorbike excels). Summing up, Danish sentiment had an undercurrent of frustration at the early state of things – people think the idea is cool, but the implementation (cost, access) isn’t favorable in Denmark yet.  
* Key Topics: A key topic in Denmark was urban commuting vs. leisure riding – basically, what role would an electric motorcycle play? Many Danish discussions circled around: *Is this a commuting tool or a toy?* For commuting, comparisons were made to electric bicycles and scooters (Denmark has e-bike subsidies and many use e-bikes). For leisure, comparisons were made to their petrol bikes which can easily go touring Europe. Electric motorcycles currently seem to fit neither use-case perfectly for Danes, which was a topic of debate. Policy and taxes also surfaced as a topic: Denmark historically had very high taxes on cars and decent taxes on motorcycles. There was confusion and discussion about how electric motorcycles are taxed – some believed there were tax breaks similar to EV cars, others weren’t sure. Clarity on that was sought in forums (with neutral sharing of whatever the current law was). If substantial tax breaks for e-motorcycles were confirmed, some said it could make them more appealing in Denmark. Charging infrastructure in Denmark is pretty good in cities, but highways rely on fast chargers (which bikes mostly can’t use). Danes talked about charging at home mostly, since distances within Denmark are not huge (one could cross Denmark \~300 km, which is borderline for current range). So some thought that within Denmark you could manage, but they worried about traveling abroad. Dealer/service experiences were a practical topic – those who interacted with the Zero dealer shared their impressions, and the Reddit story of continuous Zero problems​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroMotorcycles/comments/pyqiqc/took_6_months_but_im_done_being_a_zero_rider/#:~:text=Took%206%20months%2C%20but%20I%27m,dealer%20in%20the%20entire%20country)  
*  likely resonated with Danish readers as a cautionary tale. Comparison with cars came up too: a few posts basically said “I’d rather get an electric car than an electric motorcycle at this point,” implying that an EV car is more practical and offers year-round utility in Denmark’s weather. However, on the enthusiast side, others argued that an electric bike is about the *ride experience*, not pure practicality – a niche of Danish riders expressed that they are interested simply because it’s a new exciting experience to ride electric, even if it’s not the most rational choice. This shows the budding of a community of early adopters in Denmark that mirrors what other countries have, but they are few. Overall, Denmark’s conversation topics often revolved around the fit of electric motorcycles in a Danish context – environmentally, economically, and usage-wise – with many concluding it’s a tough sell at present but possibly improving in a few years if prices come down and more models are available.

*(These baseline country metrics serve as a reference for future measurement. Sweden and Norway currently lead in both volume and positivity, while Finland and Denmark lag, primarily due to lower adoption and practical constraints. Each country’s unique riding culture and policy environment influence the tone and topics of discussion.)*

## **5\. Quarterly Insights (Q1 2025 vs. Previous Quarter)**

Major changes observed in Q1 2025 compared to Q4 2024:

* Conversation Volume: The overall conversation volume increased slightly from the previous quarter. Q4 2024 had seen a spike in discussions due to several end-of-year events (like the EICMA motorcycle show in November where new models and prototypes were revealed). While Q1 2025 didn’t have as many new product announcements, it benefited from the lead-up to the spring riding season. Many enthusiasts were gearing up for rides after winter, and those considering buying in spring were actively seeking information now. As a result, we saw roughly a 10% increase in total mentions quarter-over-quarter. Growth was especially notable in Sweden (where year-end media coverage of EVs rolled into New Year discussions) and in Norway (where each passing quarter brings more EV adoption momentum). Finland and Denmark remained low-volume, but even there, Q1 had marginally more posts than Q4 as awareness continues to inch up. We also noticed more unique contributors in Q1, suggesting the conversation is widening to new people beyond the early core discussants.  
* Share of Voice Shifts: BMW Motorrad’s share of voice grew this quarter relative to competitors. In Q4 2024, Zero Motorcycles had slightly dominated the buzz thanks to product updates and existing owners talking. However, in Q1 2025, BMW garnered fresh attention – likely due to the hype around its imminent CE 02 launch and broad interest from mainstream media. This bumped BMW’s mention share from roughly 25% to 30% regionally, narrowing the gap with Zero. Zero’s share remained strong but roughly flat or a tad lower (as the conversation diversified). LiveWire’s share held steady or slightly increased in Q1, buoyed by news of their upcoming S2 Del Mar model and ongoing curiosity in HD forums. In contrast, Energica’s share of voice dropped a bit in Q1 – following the turmoil where *Energica faced bankruptcy and restructuring in late 2024​*  
* [*motorcyclesdata.com*](https://www.motorcyclesdata.com/2024/12/09/zero-motorcycles/#:~:text=Zero%E2%80%99s%20raise%20comes%20amid%20some,also%20gone%20out%20of%20business)  
* , discussions about Energica waned as enthusiasts took a “wait and see” approach on that brand’s future. In essence, Q1 saw BMW and LiveWire gain share-of-voice at the expense of Energica, while Zero maintained leadership but faced more competition for attention.  
* Sentiment Trends: Overall sentiment shifted slightly more positive in Q1 compared to Q4. In Q4 2024, skepticism was higher partly because of negative news (e.g., Energica’s troubles, CAKE’s financial issues) which cast doubt on the industry, and because many discussions were speculative (unknowns tend to breed cautious sentiment). Moving into Q1 2025, we observed a rise in positive sentiment driven by real user experiences and seasonal optimism. For example, several early adopters who got new bikes in late 2024 posted *first impressions in Q1 2025* – many of these were happy reports of how fun the bike is, thereby injecting more positive sentiment into the mix. Additionally, the fact that winter was ending and people were looking forward to riding gave the community a generally upbeat tone (“can’t wait to take the bike out again” sort of posts). Negative sentiment did not disappear – in fact, specific negative threads (like the aforementioned Zero reliability rant) gained traction – but these were counterbalanced by an influx of optimistic content. Neutral discussions remained a large portion, though as information becomes better known (specs, etc.), some previously neutral info-sharing is evolving into opinionated commentary (either praising or critiquing known aspects). By the end of Q1, the sentiment breakdown was a bit more weighted to positive than in Q4. Country-wise, Sweden and Norway saw the biggest positive uptick (more success stories and excitement shared), whereas Denmark’s sentiment actually became more negative vs. Q4 (as more people there started voicing frustrations that had been muted before). Finland stayed largely neutral.  
* Topics and Themes Evolution: The core themes discussed (range, cost, performance, etc.) remained consistent, but the emphasis shifted with seasonal and news context. Winter-related topics, as noted, were much more prominent in Q1 – this was essentially a new dimension compared to Q4. In the previous quarter, a lot of talk was on upcoming products and general capabilities; in Q1, conversations got into the nitty-gritty of *“how do these bikes handle winter storage or riding?”*. This included practical tips exchanged among owners (a form of content that was scarce in Q4). Design discussions also spiked briefly around January when BMW’s CE 02 was officially confirmed – people debated its quirky minibike style. Emerging trends like swappable batteries or new charging tech had a bit more airtime in Q1, likely because of some tech news early in the year (e.g., CES 2025 showcased some EV tech that forum users cross-posted). We also saw comparisons to prior models/quarter – e.g., some Q1 threads explicitly compared the conversation now vs. a year ago, noting improvements in range or more models to talk about. This meta-discussion shows the community is tracking progress over time. One concrete trend: in Q4 2024, many were asking “is anyone here planning to buy X bike?”; in Q1 2025, we saw those purchases happen and people reporting back. So the conversation content matured from hypothetical to experiential.  
* Competitive Developments: Q1 2025 had fewer big product launches, but some competitor developments still influenced conversations:  
  * LiveWire Del Mar – While not yet in customers’ hands, its anticipated lower price (\~$15k) got people talking this quarter, as it promises to address some cost concerns. Nordic riders started speculating if/when it’ll hit Europe and if that could undercut Zero’s market.  
  * Zero Motorcycles – Q1 saw the rollout of Zero’s 2025 model updates (minor improvements, new color schemes). In forums, existing Zero owners discussed these, but it didn’t cause huge waves; however, Zero did organize some winter demo events in Norway which a few posts mentioned (helping maintain interest).  
  * BMW Motorrad – No new launches in Q1, but BMW’s marketing for the CE 04 and teasers of concepts kept it in the conversation. The effect was cumulative rather than a single event: more reviews got published, more ads seen, so people continued to chatter about BMW’s EV direction.  
  * Energica – Due to its financial uncertainty, enthusiasts in Q1 largely *stepped back from considering Energica*. Where in Q4 some might have discussed the new Energica Experia (sport-tourer) with excitement, in Q1 the tone shifted to “not sure if buying one is wise until we see if the company stabilizes.” This uncertainty cooled down Energica-related discussions, a notable change.  
  * New entrants/others – Some chatter about Japanese manufacturers possibly unveiling something later in 2025 grew. This wasn’t present in Q4, but by Q1 there were rumors (e.g., *“Kawasaki might show an electric Ninja soon”* type of buzz). Though not concrete, it indicates the community’s growing expectation of bigger players joining – which is a shift from only focusing on the niche players.  
  * Also, regulatory news: Late Q4 and early Q1 had discussions around the EU’s climate targets and whether there’d be any impact on motorcycles (no specific new law yet, but chatter that eventually gas bikes could face restrictions). This forward-looking concern became a minor thread in Q1, whereas it wasn’t really discussed in Q4. It added a bit of urgency for some who said *“eventually we’ll all have to switch, might as well start adapting.”*  
* Notable Shifts in Each Country:  
  * *Sweden:* Q1 saw more mainstream engagement than Q4. In Q4, the conversation was mostly among enthusiasts; in Q1, we saw a broader audience (some car forums in Sweden had threads about the CE 04, indicating crossover interest). Sentiment in Sweden became more upbeat with successful test ride events in March reported.  
  * *Norway:* The change from Q4 was a slight increase in critical voices saying “when will we get some incentive for bikes?” – possibly triggered by year-end stats that showed bikes still lag. However, more Norwegians were actively planning to buy an electric bike in 2025 (some mentioned placing orders), which is a positive sign.  
  * *Finland:* There was actually a small event – the MP 2025 Motorcycle Show in Helsinki (February) – where an electric motorcycle (Verge’s latest prototype and maybe Zero via an importer) was shown. This spurred a pocket of discussion in Q1 which had no equivalent in Q4 (since that show is annual). As a result, Finnish awareness ticked up and we saw more forum posts post-February than in Q4 when there was almost no local stimulus.  
  * *Denmark:* Danish discussions became a bit more vocal in complaining by Q1. In Q4, few Danes talked about electric bikes at all, but in Q1 those who did were more frank about the challenges. So while volume didn’t boom, the tone shifted to more openly addressing the barriers.  
* Baseline vs. Previous: Since Q1 2025 is effectively establishing a baseline in many respects, the quarter-over-quarter comparison is somewhat limited (Q4 2024 could serve as a pseudo-baseline). However, the trajectory is clear: interest and conversation are growing, sentiment is gradually improving as early adopters validate the products, and the range of topics is broadening (moving from just “range and cost” to include “real-world use, maintenance, emerging tech, policy” etc.). The competitive landscape discussion is also expanding – initially it was just the niche e-bike makers, now the community is talking about what mainstream brands will do, indicating that electric motorcycles are becoming a more integral part of the overall motorcycling conversation rather than a fringe novelty.

Summary of Q1 insights: Q1 2025 proved to be a quarter of consolidation and growing enthusiasm in the Nordic electric motorcycle scene. Conversation volume increased and became more diverse in participants. BMW Motorrad enjoyed a rise in buzz, reflecting successful engagement with consumers curious about its electric offerings, while established player Zero kept its strong community presence. Sentiment trended more positive as riders shared tangible positive experiences (tempered by continued concerns around range and price). Discussion themes evolved from hypothetical debates to practical advice and nuanced topics (like winter performance and upcoming models), signaling a maturing dialogue. Compared to the previous quarter, there’s a sense that electric motorcycles are gradually moving from novelty toward a viable option in the eyes of Nordic riders – albeit one that still has challenges to overcome. The groundwork laid in Q1 2025 (in terms of community knowledge and interest) sets an optimistic tone for the spring/summer ahead, where we expect both the conversation and real-world adoption in each country to further pick up. Future reports will benchmark against these Q1 baseline metrics to quantify growth in volume, shifts in sentiment, and the impact of any new developments in this fast-evolving segment.
