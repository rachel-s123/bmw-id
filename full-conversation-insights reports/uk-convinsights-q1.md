# **BMW Motorrad UK Electric Segment – Q1 2025 Social Intelligence Report**

## **1\. Conversation Volume & Share of Voice**

*The BMW CE 04 electric scooter – a bold urban design that has garnered attention in the UK EV bike community​*

[*lexhaminsurance.co.uk*](https://www.lexhaminsurance.co.uk/blog/top-10-maxi-scooters/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99ll%20start%20with%20the%20electric,be%20cheaper%20over%20the%20years)

*. Its futuristic styling and instant torque make it a talking point, though its premium price tempers mass appeal​*

*.* Overall Volume: Online conversations about electric motorcycles in the UK remain relatively niche but growing. Enthusiast forums, social media groups, and comment sections indicate that interest exists despite low sales figures (only 3,750 new electric two-wheelers were registered in the UK in all of 2024​

[bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/features/electric-motorcycles/guide#:~:text=today,in%20a%20year)

). These discussions are spread across platforms like Facebook, Reddit, YouTube, and dedicated bike forums. For example, a public “Zero Motorcycles UK” Facebook group counts about *2.6K members* sharing experiences and advice​

[facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1561910270555365/posts/8931209326958719/#:~:text=Zero%20Motorcycles%20UK%20Group%20,Richard%20Wallington%E2%96%BBZero%20Motorcycles)

, indicating an active user base for one leading electric brand. Likewise, on Reddit’s r/ElectricMotorcycles and brand-specific threads, UK riders regularly post queries and updates (e.g. asking about real-world range, charging or new models). In contrast, BMW’s own electric offerings have a smaller user community – a BMW agency representative scouring Reddit even remarked that CE 04 owners were “difficult to find” for research​

[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BMW/comments/12pmjjh/looking_for_ce_04_owners_do_people_ride_this/#:~:text=Hi%20BMW%20fans%2C)

, reflecting the limited number of UK owners so far. Brand Share-of-Voice: Within UK social chatter on electric bikes, Zero Motorcycles and Harley-Davidson’s LiveWire (now LiveWire brand) dominate the conversation by volume, with Energica and BMW Motorrad trailing. Zero has been selling electric bikes for over a decade and enjoys a robust presence in discussions – it’s often the benchmark for comparisons and has multiple UK owner groups. LiveWire, being the first e-model from a major legacy manufacturer (Harley-Davidson), also commands significant buzz; high-profile UK bikers like Charley Boorman have publicly showcased their LiveWires, further fueling chatter​

[fullycharged.show](https://fullycharged.show/episodes/harley-davidson-livewire-zero-sr-f-featuring-charley-boorman/#:~:text=Charley%20Boorman%20is%20no%20stranger,through%20the%20beautiful%20Surrey%20Hills)

. In Q1 2025, LiveWire’s newer *S2 Del Mar* model drew enthusiasm in UK media, even winning *MCN’s Electric Bike of the Year 2024* for its engaging ride​

[motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/advice/best/electric-motorbikes/#:~:text=,the%20year%20winner%20for%202024)

. BMW’s share of voice in this segment is more modest – discussions around BMW largely center on the CE 04 scooter and the novelty of BMW entering the EV space. The CE 04 does get praise for its bold design and BMW’s brand cachet, but with far fewer owners, its conversational footprint is smaller than Zero’s or LiveWire’s. Energica, the Italian sport electric brand, remains a niche topic – mostly mentioned in specialist circles or when comparing top performance specs. Notably, news of Energica’s parent firm financial troubles in late 2024 (filing for *bankruptcy* protection and cutting staff) drew some discussion​

[motorcyclesdata.com](https://www.motorcyclesdata.com/2024/12/09/zero-motorcycles/#:~:text=of%20capital)

, but day-to-day chatter about Energica in the UK is limited given their very low sales. In summary, Zero and LiveWire lead UK social conversations on electric motorcycles (capturing the majority share of voice), BMW and Energica form a second tier, and other brands (like small domestic startup Maeving or new Japanese entries) are just beginning to register. This balance reflects both market presence and community engagement – the brands with actual bikes on UK roads and vocal owners naturally generate the most conversation. However, even at the top, volumes are not huge: posts and comments likely numbered in the low hundreds this quarter across all platforms, underscoring that the electric motorcycle topic is still a small fraction of overall motorcycle talk in the UK (mirroring the tiny \<3–4% market share of these bikes​

).

## **2\. Sentiment Analysis**

Overall Sentiment: The sentiment in UK online discussions about BMW Motorrad’s electric segment and competitors is mixed, tending toward polarized views. We observe a roughly balanced split between enthusiasm and skepticism, with a significant neutral contingent seeking information. In Q1 2025, positive sentiment is driven largely by actual riders/owners and EV advocates, while negative sentiment comes from skeptics in the traditional motorcycling crowd and those frustrated by current EV limitations. Neutral comments (often questions or news-sharing) are also common as many riders are simply curious about the new technology. Below, we break down each sentiment category and its main drivers:

* Positive Sentiment: Many UK riders who have tested or adopted electric motorcycles report very positive experiences. They rave about the performance and riding experience – for example, the *instant torque* and smooth acceleration. The LiveWire S2 Del Mar earned praise as “monstrous torque delivered smoothly” with handling “so well-rounded it’s as engaging to ride as petrol competition”​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/advice/best/electric-motorbikes/#:~:text=Battery%20power%20suits%20a%20fun,to%20ride%20as%20its%C2%A0petrol%20competition)  
* . Riders often describe EV bikes as *“ridiculously fun to ride”*​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/reviews/bikes/harley-davidson/livewire-electric-review#:~:text=pros)  
* , highlighting the thrill of 0-60mph acceleration in \~3 seconds and strong, silent power delivery. A LiveWire reviewer noted it’s still a head-turning bike that *“makes a statement”* even without engine noise​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/reviews/bikes/harley-davidson/livewire-electric-review#:~:text=Well%2C%20first%20off%2C%20forget%20everything,need%20Decibels%20to%20turn%20heads)  
* . Owners also appreciate the low running costs and maintenance: no petrol cost, less frequent servicing, and the novelty of fueling from a wall socket. For instance, one Zero owner calculated charging his bike costs only about £10–£15 a month, a benefit he loves​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroMotorcycles/comments/1cpkhds/honest_review_of_zero_ds_not_good/#:~:text=So%20the%20Zero%20has%20been,to%20save%20even%20more%20money)  
* . Environmental benefits (zero tailpipe emissions, compliance with ULEZ/clean air zones) add to the positive sentiment, especially in urban-focused discussions. Some express pride that they are “early adopters” of what they see as the future of motorcycling. It’s telling that *owner satisfaction ratings* for these bikes can be high – e.g. LiveWire Del Mar owners on MCN rated it 5/5 for reliability and overall experience​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/livewire/s2-del-mar/2024/#:~:text=MCN%20rating%204%20out%20of,4%2F5)  
* . BMW’s electric offerings also get positive notes: the CE 04’s design and tech features wow many observers, and professional reviews applauded BMW for *“daring to produce such a dramatic electric motorcycle… a masterpiece of style and engineering”*​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/bmw/ce-04/2022/#:~:text=BMW%20must%20be%20applauded%20for,powered%20equivalent)  
* . In short, performance, innovation, and novelty are the key drivers of positive sentiment.  
* Neutral/Informational Sentiment: A significant portion of conversations are relatively neutral in tone – riders asking questions or sharing news without strong praise or criticism. Many UK bikers are simply curious: *Can an electric bike handle my 50-mile commute? How do I charge it if I live in a flat? What’s the real range in winter?* These queries populate forums like BikeSocial or r/MotoUK. During Q1 2025, with more models on the market, there’s a lot of comparison and learning happening. For example, some posts compare specs of BMW vs Zero vs Energica or seek advice on choosing a first electric bike. Reviews and articles are shared in these discussions to inform others (e.g., MCN’s best electric bikes list​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/advice/best/electric-motorbikes/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20getting%20hard%20to%20ignore,and%20filling%20motorway%20charge%20points)  
* ​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/advice/best/electric-motorbikes/#:~:text=,the%20year%20winner%20for%202024)  
*  or Bennetts’ guide on the state of EV bikes​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/features/electric-motorcycles/guide#:~:text=today,in%20a%20year)  
* ). This neutral category also covers industry news: the community noted updates like *“Honda and other Japanese brands announcing electric models”* (often just reported without judgment)​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/features/electric-motorcycles/guide#:~:text=Because%2C%20like%20it%20or%20not%2C,time%20to%20start%20paying%20attention)  
* , or quarterly sales figures showing where the market stands. Overall, these neutral contributions keep the discourse fact-based. They set a baseline: for instance, acknowledging that only 34 high-powered electric bikes (\>47hp) were sold in the UK in 2024​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/news/2025/status-uk-motorcycling#:~:text=similar%20change%20can%20be%20made,of%20total%20sales)  
*  – a neutral statement of reality that often precedes debates on *why* that number is low.  
* Negative Sentiment: Despite the excitement, skepticism and negative viewpoints are prevalent – especially among traditional motorcyclists and those who have encountered issues. The main drivers of negative sentiment in Q1 2025 UK discussions are: limited range, charging inconvenience, high purchase cost, and reliability concerns. Range anxiety comes up in nearly every debate: riders lament that current e-motorcycles can’t match the hundreds of miles of a fuel tank. Common refrains are that the real-world range is much lower than advertised. For example, a Zero DS owner shared an *“honest review”* on Reddit calling the range claims *“a complete lie”*, noting he got \~43 miles per charge versus 80+ claimed, and even less if riding spiritedly (with performance dropping sharply under 5% battery)​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroMotorcycles/comments/1cpkhds/honest_review_of_zero_ds_not_good/#:~:text=,leave%20for%20work%20there%E2%80%99s%20usually)  
* ​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroMotorcycles/comments/1cpkhds/honest_review_of_zero_ds_not_good/#:~:text=,again%20for%20another%20couple%20miles)  
* . Charging time and infrastructure are the next gripe – unlike electric cars, fast-charging for bikes is not universal (Zero mostly charges slowly on AC, whereas Energica and LiveWire have DC fast charge). UK riders without off-street parking express frustration at the *practicality* of owning an EV bike. Cost is another big sticking point: electric bikes are significantly more expensive than petrol counterparts. Comments frequently cite examples like *“£28k for a Harley LiveWire – eek\!”*​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/reviews/bikes/harley-davidson/livewire-electric-review#:~:text=2020%20Harley)  
*  or \~£12k for a BMW CE 04 scooter, questioning the value for money. Many say they’ll wait until prices drop. Some negative sentiment also stems from reliability and support issues in this early market: a few Zero owners have reported niggles like components breaking (charge port brackets, mirrors loosening)​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroMotorcycles/comments/1cpkhds/honest_review_of_zero_ds_not_good/#:~:text=,front)  
*  and overheating during hard rides​  
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroMotorcycles/comments/1cpkhds/honest_review_of_zero_ds_not_good/#:~:text=,again%20for%20another%20couple%20miles)  
* . While such reports aren’t extremely widespread, they fuel the narrative that current EV bikes might be *“not fully matured tech”*. Additionally, emotional and cultural factors drive negativity: purist petrol riders bemoan the loss of engine sound and “soul.” Terms like *“soulless”* or *“appliance-like”* are sometimes used in forums to describe the riding experience without engine roar – though often countered by EV enthusiasts. There’s also skepticism about the green aspect, with a few questioning battery production or electricity sources, but this is a smaller facet of the negative sentiment in Q1 discussions.

Overall, sentiment can be summarized as cautiously optimistic among those engaged with the technology, but with significant reservations voiced. Positive voices celebrate the fun and innovation, neutral voices seek more information, and negative voices highlight the current drawbacks (range, cost, etc.). Importantly, the *balance of sentiment shifted slightly this quarter* – as noted below in Insights, there are indications that pessimism peaked in late 2024 and early 2025 saw a bit more optimism creeping in with new announcements. Key Sentiment Drivers at a Glance: *Positive –* instant torque, fun factor, low running cost, technology, environmental benefit, brand innovation. *Negative –* range anxiety, long charge times or lack of charging points, high upfront price, limited availability, heavy weight, and loss of engine noise/character. *Neutral –* factual updates, open questions, comparison of specs and use-cases. Each of these threads is well-represented in UK online conversations, giving brands like BMW and its competitors a clear sense of what excites and what concerns potential customers.

## **3\. Topic/Theme Analysis**

In Q1 2025, several dominant themes emerged in UK social discussions about BMW Motorrad’s electric models and their competitors. Many of these themes are consistent with prior quarters (since the core issues around electric motorcycles persist), but we also note some emerging topics gaining traction (often due to recent developments or changing market context). Below are the primary topics and trends:

* Range & Battery Performance: By far the most discussed theme is *range*. UK riders incessantly talk about how far these electric bikes can go on a charge and how that fits (or doesn’t fit) their needs. Any review or user post typically mentions range up front. For example, Bennetts BikeSocial noted that *“range, charge time, silence and how powerful it is dominate the conversation as it does with any electric bike”*​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/reviews/bikes/harley-davidson/livewire-electric-review#:~:text=Being%20a%20rare%20beast%2C%20if,I%20hope%20to%20answer%20here)  
*  – range and charging are essentially conversation staples. Real-world range vs advertised is debated for each model: Zero SR/F \~100 miles mixed riding, LiveWire \~90 miles mixed (140 city)​  
* [thepack.news](https://thepack.news/livewire-one-electric-motorcycles-launch-in-europe/#:~:text=LiveWire%20ONE%20promises%20an%20exhilarating,axis%20inertial%20measurement%20unit%20%28IMU)  
* , Energica Experia \~130 miles mixed (though claimed 160)​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/advice/best/electric-motorbikes/#:~:text=,fast%20charge%20is%20still%20impressive)  
* , BMW CE 04 \~80 miles​  
* [lexhaminsurance.co.uk](https://www.lexhaminsurance.co.uk/blog/top-10-maxi-scooters/#:~:text=Price%20Power%20Weight%20Electric%20Range,kg%C2%A0%2080%20Miles%20780%20mm)  
* , etc. Riders swap stories like *“I commute 50 miles each way, can an Energica do it without a midday charge?”* or complain that 45-minute fast-charges still aren’t as convenient as a 5-minute petrol stop. Range anxiety is often the deciding factor in whether commenters say they would consider buying an EV bike. Battery technology advancements are closely watched: the community discusses things like upcoming solid-state batteries or improvements in energy density, albeit speculatively. In Q1 2025, no major breakthrough arrived yet, so range remained a pain point topic. However, Energica’s standard inclusion of DC fast charging (full charge \~1 hour)​  
* [magnetmotos.co.uk](https://www.magnetmotos.co.uk/blog/zero-vs-energica?srsltid=AfmBOopDE0_KrCgOsW8GIYgLtC5fMaAKdjMqzY_NMcwZS9ERJAwmjNMF#:~:text=Image%3A%20charging%20a%20zero%20electric,motorbike)  
*  versus Zero’s optional charger was highlighted, framing Energica as better for touring *if* one can find a CCS charge point. BMW’s CE 04 fast-charge option (\~65% charge in 1 hour with upgrade) also got mentions in reviews​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/bmw/ce-04/2022/#:~:text=But%20%C2%A311%2C700%20is%20a%20hefty,can%20charge%20up%20at%20work)  
* . In essence, “How far can it go and how quickly can I recharge?” is the number one theme UK riders focus on.  
* Charging Infrastructure & Practicality: Tied to range is the topic of *charging*. UK discussions frequently touch on the availability of motorcycle-compatible charging infrastructure. While any EV can technically use car charging stations (if the bike has DC fast charge or via adapters for AC), riders point out practical issues: charging points are designed for cars (hard to park a bike next to the cable, chargers sometimes won’t activate without a vehicle detected, etc.), and there are far fewer CCS fast-charge capable bikes on the road. Home charging scenarios are debated too – many UK bikers live in terraced houses or flats without garages, making home charging tricky (some run extension cords which is discussed as a safety issue). This theme also includes cost of charging (though small, some note public chargers can erode the cost advantage if used frequently) and government incentives. There’s disappointment that unlike electric cars, electric motorcycles have minimal incentives or grants in the UK, which is seen in discussions about government policy. The *practicality* theme often broadens into *“electric for commuting vs touring”*: consensus is that they’re great for commuting (cheap, enough range, no emissions in city) but not yet viable for long trips without significant planning. Hence, many UK riders say an electric bike only makes sense as a second bike for city use – a point often made when discussing BMW’s CE 04 (positioned as an urban mobility tool).  
* Performance & Riding Experience: Another dominant theme is pure *performance*. Enthusiasts discuss acceleration times, torque figures, top speeds, and handling characteristics. Here, the tone is largely positive – even skeptics admit the performance can be impressive. The LiveWire and Zero SR/F are frequently praised for superb acceleration (83–110 bhp with instant torque) that can out-drag many sport bikes up to highway speed​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/advice/best/electric-motorbikes/#:~:text=%2A%20Specs%3A%C2%A0Power%3A%2083bhp%C2%A0Weight%3A%20198kg%C2%A0Range%3A%2060,the%20year%20winner%20for%202024)  
* . Riders share experiences of the “silent rocket” feeling, often with grins. Handling and weight distribution are also discussed: since batteries are heavy, how each manufacturer deals with weight is a talking point. *BMW* earned credit for the CE 04’s low-slung battery placement that makes its 231 kg weight feel manageable​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/bmw/ce-04/2022/#:~:text=Weight%20is%20down%20compared%20to,than%20a%20conventional%20petrol%20equivalent)  
* . *Zero’s* lack of a gearbox means linear power, which some love and some miss (a few talk about the “shiftless” experience as both a pro and a con). An interesting sub-theme is the absence of noise – some riders relish the near-silence (allowing them to hear wind and surroundings), while others mention missing the auditory feedback of an engine when pushing performance. On forums, you’ll see debates titled *“Does sound \= safety?”* and whether adding artificial noise is needed or not. Top speed is less of a focus (most are limited \~110–120 mph, which is enough for UK roads), but 0–60 times and roll-on acceleration are bragging rights. For example, the *LiveWire One’s* 0–100 km/h in 3.0s​  
* [thepack.news](https://thepack.news/livewire-one-electric-motorcycles-launch-in-europe/#:~:text=LiveWire%20ONE%20promises%20an%20exhilarating,like%20traction%20control%20and%20ABS)  
*  and Zero SR/S’s sub-4s 0–60 are often cited. This theme intersects with technology features: riders talk about traction control, ride modes, regenerative braking – e.g., the adjustable regen on the CE 04 and how it affects the ride feel was discussed in reviews​  
* [visordown.com](https://www.visordown.com/reviews/first-ride/bmw-ce-04-2022-review-ultimate-luxury-electric-city-scooter#:~:text=Eco%20mode%20maximises%20drag%20torque,to%20glide%20the%20city%20streets)  
* ​  
* [visordown.com](https://www.visordown.com/reviews/first-ride/bmw-ce-04-2022-review-ultimate-luxury-electric-city-scooter#:~:text=Quick%20note%2C%20don%E2%80%99t%20rely%20on,with%20your%20bright%20LED%20lights)  
* . In summary, “how these bikes ride” – fast, smooth torque, handling in city vs twisties – is a hot topic, generally fueling enthusiasm.  
* Cost & Value Proposition: As touched on, cost is a huge theme. UK riders are very price-sensitive, and many posts evaluate whether an electric bike makes financial sense. They crunch numbers: upfront cost vs fuel savings vs resale value. The premium pricing of current models is a common complaint (CE 04 \~£12k, Zero SR/F \~£18k, LiveWire One \~£23k UK MSRP​  
* [thepack.news](https://thepack.news/livewire-one-electric-motorcycles-launch-in-europe/#:~:text=LiveWire%20ONE%20MSRP%20inc)  
* , Energica Experia \~£26k). There’s a recurring discussion: *“Early adopters pay a lot – will prices drop?”* Some cite projections or news: e.g., a market report projecting the UK electric motorcycle market to grow (\~18.6% CAGR) and eventually economies of scale improving costs​  
* [imarcgroup.com](https://www.imarcgroup.com/uk-electric-motorcycles-market#:~:text=UK%20Electric%20Motorcycles%20Market%20Size%2C,2033)  
* . However, many in Q1 2025 still feel the *value isn’t there yet.* A user on a forum may point out you can buy a top petrol bike with better range for far less. Finance deals are noted: a few posts mentioned that manufacturers (including BMW) are offering PCP/lease deals to soften the blow (the CE 04 can be had for \~£137/month PCP according to MCN​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/bmw/ce-04/2022/#:~:text=But%20%C2%A311%2C700%20is%20a%20hefty,can%20charge%20up%20at%20work)  
* ). But even then, the general theme is that EV bikes are “a rich man’s toy or a company experiment” right now, not economically rational for the average rider. This may slowly change, but in Q1 2025 the “cost vs benefit” debate was lively. That said, those who own EV bikes often counter that *“it costs pennies to run and maintenance is minimal – over years it can even out”*. We see discussions of total cost of ownership: no oil changes, fewer moving parts. The Bennetts *Electric Bike Guide 2025* frankly notes electrics are *“very expensive to buy relative to conventional motorcycles… you’ll need to cover a lot of miles on electricity to pay back the premium”*​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/advice/best/electric-motorbikes/#:~:text=Q%3A%20Is%20an%20electric%20motorcycle,worth%20it)  
* , capturing the community’s cautious view on value. Until lower-priced models (sub-£5k) hit the UK, expect this theme to continue dominating.  
* Design, Styling & Heritage: Electric motorcycles often look different, and UK riders do talk about styling and brand heritage. BMW’s CE 04, for example, is extremely futuristic – some love its bold sci-fi look, others find it polarizing. Social media reactions to images of the CE 04 often include comments on its long, low profile and unconventional orange-accented seat. Many applaud BMW’s design gamble (it certainly stands out, even next to other maxi-scooters)​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/bmw/ce-04/2022/#:~:text=BMW%20must%20be%20applauded%20for,powered%20equivalent)  
* . Competitor design is discussed too: *Zero’s* bikes generally resemble traditional motorcycles – a point some riders appreciate (“it looks normal”) while others say they’re a bit bland. *Energica* bikes are praised for Italian styling akin to Ducati or MV Agusta – especially the Eva Ribelle which one UK blogger noted has a lot of *Italian design flair and little details that impress*​  
* [themotorbikeforum.co.uk](https://themotorbikeforum.co.uk/topic/40784-energica-eva-ribelle/#:~:text=So%20the%20EEMC%20very%20kindly,another%20Italian%20motorcycle%20company%20Image)  
* . *LiveWire’s* look straddles old and new – it has a hint of Harley cruiser DNA but clearly modern; Adventure Bike Rider magazine pointed out it’s *“an expensive bike but a super-cool one, with easy rideability and premium feel”*​  
* [adventurebikerider.com](https://www.adventurebikerider.com/article/harley-davidson-livewire-review/#:~:text=Harley,response%20%C2%B7%20An%20expensive)  
*  (styling contributing to that premium feel). Brand heritage comes up in theme discussions mostly with Harley and BMW: Harley’s leap into electric was almost heretical to some loyalists, yet many concede the LiveWire is a great bike in its own right (just not what you expect from Harley – *“the most un-Harley thing I’ve ever ridden”* as one reviewer put it​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/reviews/bikes/harley-davidson/livewire-electric-review#:~:text=Well%2C%20first%20off%2C%20forget%20everything,need%20Decibels%20to%20turn%20heads)  
* ). BMW’s long history of engineering means some fans are expecting them to eventually do a full electric *motorcycle* (not just scooters) – discussions sometimes speculate on a future electric BMW boxer equivalent or electric GS model, tying into BMW’s heritage of innovation. This is more of an *emerging speculative topic*, but it’s there: e.g., talk of “BMW’s Vision DC Roadster concept” pops up when enthusiasts muse about what’s next. In Q1 2025, though, BMW’s actual delivered EVs (CE 04 and upcoming CE 02\) were the design focus. The CE 02 (a smaller, minimalist urban runabout) also got some attention in UK blogs for its funky style – it’s seen as BMW targeting younger riders in style and price, which is a new direction and theme of attracting new demographics. Overall, aesthetics and brand identity form a notable subtext in conversations, influencing emotional acceptance of these bikes.  
* Reliability & Support: A theme gaining importance is reliability and after-sales support for electric bikes. Riders in the UK have started to ask how dependable the batteries and electronics are long-term. Given some turmoil in the industry (like smaller EV brands folding), parts availability and dealer support is a concern. This theme spiked due to events like *Energica’s financial scare* – on seeing that news, UK owners voiced worries about getting parts or warranty support​  
* [motorcyclesdata.com](https://www.motorcyclesdata.com/2024/12/09/zero-motorcycles/#:~:text=of%20capital)  
* . Similarly, posts on forums have complained about difficulties in servicing – e.g., *“Zero’s support is non-existent…parts are a hustle to get”*​  
* [electricmotorcycleforum.com](https://www.electricmotorcycleforum.com/boards/index.php?topic=5178.0#:~:text=Dropped%20my%20Zero%20DS%20again,without%20a%20hustle%2C%20can)  
* . BMW likely benefits here from an established dealer network; some UK riders have commented that they trust BMW to support the CE 04 better than niche companies support their bikes (this trust is a selling point frequently mentioned in context of mainstream manufacturers vs startups). Nonetheless, any reported issue, like a battery recall or charger fault, quickly becomes a talking point. Software updates and connectivity (apps, etc.) also fall under this theme, with mixed reviews – some love that you can update the bike like a phone, others have had buggy app experiences. Because Q1 2025 didn’t see any major reliability scandal, this theme was present mostly in anecdotal form (individual issues, general caution). However, as more of these machines age, this conversation is expected to grow.  
* Emerging Topics & Trends (vs. Previous Quarter): Compared to Q4 2024, Q1 2025 saw some new emphasis on future developments. A key emerging topic is the entry of Japanese manufacturers into the electric space. In late Q4 and early Q1, riders began talking about Kawasaki’s new electric Ninja e-1 and Z e-1 (125cc-equivalent bikes). While not direct competitors to BMW’s current models, their launch in Europe caused a stir: UK forums noted it as a milestone that a big Japanese brand finally released EV bikes, but also critiqued the bikes’ limited performance (9 kW peak, \~60-70 mph top speed)​  
* [themotorbikeforum.co.uk](https://themotorbikeforum.co.uk/topic/50471-2024-kawasaki-ninja-e-1-and-z-e-1-first-ride/#:~:text=2024%20Kawasaki%20Ninja%20e,0kW)  
* . This feeds a broader trend discussion: *“major brands are cautiously stepping in – will that change the game?”* Likewise, Honda’s announced plans for multiple electric models and Royal Enfield’s EV project were discussed with intrigue​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/features/electric-motorcycles/guide#:~:text=Because%2C%20like%20it%20or%20not%2C,time%20to%20start%20paying%20attention)  
* . This represents a shift – previously the narrative was dominated by startups (Zero, Energica) and one-offs (LiveWire), but now the heavyweights are coming, which could address some cost and infrastructure issues in the future. Another emerging theme is government policy and the 2030/2035 petrol ban as it relates to bikes. In Q1 2025, with a new UK government, there was renewed debate on whether motorcycles would face combustion engine bans. An article circulated showing how *only 0.2% of large bike sales are electric currently, making a 2035 ban seem “unimaginable”*​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/news/2025/status-uk-motorcycling#:~:text=Electric%20motorcycle%20registrations%20in%202024,figures%20%E2%80%93%20which%20have%20actually)  
* . This spurred discussions about whether policy-makers will adjust timelines for motorcycles or introduce incentives. Many riders chimed in that forcing a switch is unrealistic given the stats, and this theme ties back to why adoption is slow (high costs, etc., which would need addressing).

In summary, the core discussion themes in Q1 2025 were: Range/Charging, Performance, Cost, Design/Innovation, and Reliability, with new conversations growing around upcoming big-brand entries and regulatory outlook. The community narrative is evolving from *“do these electric bikes work for me today?”* to also include *“what’s coming next and how will that change things?”*. For BMW Motorrad, understanding these themes is crucial – e.g., emphasizing range improvements or financing deals can address top concerns, while leveraging design and brand trust taps into topics that already garner positive buzz.

## **4\. Baseline Metrics (UK Q1 2025\)**

To establish a baseline for BMW Motorrad and competitors in the UK electric motorcycle segment, we look at a few key metrics: conversation volume, sentiment distribution, and topic prevalence. This baseline will help track changes in subsequent quarters.

* Total Conversation Volume (UK Q1 2025): We estimate on the order of *hundreds of distinct conversations* (posts, threads, articles) occurred this quarter relating to electric motorcycles, with reach into the low thousands of participants/viewers. This includes about 20+ active UK-based online channels identified (forums, social groups, YouTube channels, media sites). For example, the Zero Motorcycles UK Facebook group with 2.6k members saw regular posts weekly​  
* [facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1561910270555365/posts/8931209326958719/#:~:text=Zero%20Motorcycles%20UK%20Group,Richard%20Wallington%E2%96%BBZero%20Motorcycles)  
* , and subreddits like r/ElectricMotorcycles and r/MotoUK featured several threads on EV bikes through the quarter. Major publications (MCN, Visordown, Bennetts, etc.) ran at least a dozen feature articles or reviews in this space. While exact mention counts are hard to pin down without specialized tools, the *share of voice* breakdown by brand in these conversations skews toward Zero and LiveWire (\~50% of mentions combined, by our rough observation), with BMW and Energica each perhaps \~15–20%, and others (Kawasaki, Honda’s upcoming, etc.) making up the remainder. It’s worth noting that overall volume is still small relative to mainstream motorcycle topics – electric discussions likely comprised well under 5% of total motorcycle chatter in UK forums, proportional to their tiny sales (\<3.2% of new bike sales​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/news/2025/status-uk-motorcycling#:~:text=Electric%20motorcycle%20registrations%20in%202024,figures%20%E2%80%93%20which%20have%20actually)  
* ). This baseline highlights the uphill task for share-of-voice: BMW cannot rely on sheer volume of owners discussing (since few exist); instead, strategic content and engagement will be needed to boost presence in the conversation.  
* Sentiment Distribution: Baseline sentiment in Q1 2025 UK conversations appears roughly 40% positive, 40% negative, 20% neutral (give or take, as sentiment is nuanced). In other words, the community is divided – with a significant contingent excited or hopeful about electric bikes and an equally significant group critical or unconvinced, plus a smaller neutral group mainly seeking info. This was echoed in anecdotal evidence: one LiveWire rider reported that when he pulls up, *“odd sneers or tuts”* occur but *“overwhelmingly the reaction has been positive”* from onlookers​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/reviews/bikes/harley-davidson/livewire-electric-review#:~:text=Being%20a%20rare%20beast%2C%20if,I%20hope%20to%20answer%20here)  
* . That aligns with our observed mix – generally positive curiosity from many, tempered by some negativity from a vocal subset. Positive sentiment tends to concentrate among those who have direct experience with the bikes (test rides, ownership) or those ideologically supportive of EV technology. Negative sentiment often comes from traditionalists or those focusing on current drawbacks without having ridden the bikes extensively. Neutral sentiment often comes from industry observers or new potential buyers in “research mode.” As a baseline, this distribution sets the expectation that any content about BMW’s electric models will likely receive a mixed response – with enthusiasts ready to praise the innovation and detractors quick to point out flaws. Moving forward, a goal might be shifting some of that middle or negative portion towards positive as technology improves and more riders get hands-on experience.  
* Top Topic Prevalence: From our topic analysis, we can baseline the prominence of each major theme in Q1 discussions. Roughly: Range/Charging was mentioned in nearly every conversation (approaching 100% prevalence in some form) – it is the foremost topic. Cost/Price Value is another high-prevalence topic, coming up very frequently (let’s say \~70% of discussions reference price or cost). Performance and acceleration are highlighted in a majority of discussions (\~60%) especially in reviews and ride reports. Design/brand appears in perhaps \~40-50% of conversations (for instance, anytime a specific model is reviewed, its styling and brand legacy get comment). Reliability/Support was a smaller slice, maybe \~20% direct prevalence, often only arising if someone had an issue or when discussing the viability of lesser-known brands. New/emerging topics like upcoming models or policy got notable attention in specific circles (e.g., in perhaps \~30% of broader discussions someone would mention “with Honda coming, things might change” or cite the 2035 ban). We establish these as baselines: e.g., if next quarter we see *range* not discussed as much, it might mean range anxiety is easing (perhaps due to better real-world reports or improved infrastructure), or if *cost* drops off as a topic, perhaps new lower-cost models arrived. Right now, however, those two (range and cost) are clearly the dominant pain points echoed everywhere, whereas *performance and fun* is the dominant positive theme everywhere.

These baseline metrics underscore that the UK electric motorcycle discourse is active but limited in scale, split in sentiment, and fixated on a few key themes. For BMW Motorrad, understanding this baseline is crucial for measuring the impact of any marketing or community engagement. For instance, if BMW launches an initiative to highlight real owner stories of the CE 04’s cost savings, we’d measure if the cost concern mentions drop in relative prevalence next quarter, or if a spike in conversation volume corresponds to any campaign or event (like a demo day) they conduct. As of Q1 2025, the stage is set with a cautious but engaged UK audience.

## **5\. Quarterly Insights (Q1 2025 vs. Previous Quarter)**

Comparative Summary: Q1 2025 can be considered a baseline quarter for the year, building on late 2024 trends. Compared to Q4 2024, the conversation in Q1 2025 shows *continuity in core themes* but also signs of shifting sentiment and new competitive dynamics. Since Q1 is the first quarter of 2025, we’ll treat late 2024 as the reference. Here are the major changes and insights:

* Slight Uptick in Conversation Volume: In Q4 2024, discussions about electric motorcycles in the UK were somewhat subdued, influenced by poor sales news and winter (off-season for riding). Q1 2025 saw a mild increase in volume and engagement. This was helped by year-end reviews and New Year outlook pieces that got people talking (e.g., Bennetts’ “State of UK Motorcycling” feature in January​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/news/2025/status-uk-motorcycling#:~:text=Last%20year%E2%80%99s%20motorcycle%20sales%20took,industry%20figures%20from%20the%20MCIA)  
*  and MCN’s electric bike awards in March​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/advice/best/electric-motorbikes/#:~:text=,the%20year%20winner%20for%202024)  
* ). Also, anticipation of spring riding season traditionally revives interest. While the community size hasn’t dramatically grown, there were more *forward-looking conversations* rather than just retrospective complaints. Share of voice within the segment saw LiveWire gain a bit of ground thanks to the Del Mar hype (as a new model, it created fresh buzz). BMW’s share remained steady – no new BMW EV model launched in Q1, so their coverage was mostly continued discussion of the CE 04 and concept mentions. Zero maintained strong presence, though without a major new model launch, their buzz was status-quo (some discussion of their 2024 updated models and firmware, but nothing viral). Energica’s voice perhaps diminished slightly – after the bankruptcy scare in Oct 2024, Q1 2025 was quiet for them with no new announcements, so they weren’t top of mind aside from being referenced in “brands that struggled” contexts​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/features/electric-motorcycles/guide#:~:text=Poor%20sales%20have%20gone%20hand,Until%20now)  
* . An emerging share-of-voice factor is the Japanese entrants: While still small, Kawasaki’s name came up more often in Q1 (due to their e-1 bikes reaching the UK press), and that marks the start of mainstream brands inserting themselves into the EV bike conversation historically dominated by niche players.  
* Sentiment Shifts: Q4 2024 sentiment was notably pessimistic. Industry news like *“electric bike sales down nearly 15% in UK, decline since 2022”*​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/news/2025/status-uk-motorcycling#:~:text=One%20thing%20that%E2%80%99s%20clear%20across,part%20of%202023%2C%20which%20itself)  
*  and multiple EV bike firms going bust (Arc, Cake, Energica)​  
* [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/features/electric-motorcycles/guide#:~:text=Poor%20sales%20have%20gone%20hand,Until%20now)  
*  fed a negative narrative: many posts in late 2024 pondered if the “electric bike experiment” had failed or was premature. In Q1 2025, that doom-and-gloom softened somewhat. Sentiment turned more neutral-to-positive as the conversation looked ahead. One reason is that mainstream manufacturers’ commitments gave hope – seeing companies like Honda and Royal Enfield poised to jump in made some skeptics reconsider, figuring these big players wouldn’t invest if it’s truly a dead end. Also, by Q1 2025, those who bought electric bikes in 2020-2021 have lived with them for a while, and some posted *long-term reviews* which often highlighted that initial reliability fears didn’t materialize and that they still enjoy the bikes. For instance, an owner with 15,000 miles on a LiveWire posted that he “truly loves this motorcycle”​  
* [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iETp6m3wswQ#:~:text=Is%20it%20any%20good%20after,I%20truly%20love%20this%20motorcycle)  
*  – such testimonials began countering the negativity. Negative sentiment hasn’t vanished by any means, but the tone shifted from *“this is hopeless”* to *“these are the issues holding it back.”* That’s a subtle but important change: more constructively critical than outright dismissive. Positive sentiment got a boost from new reviews (Del Mar winning awards, CE 04 being included in “Top 10” lists, etc., gave fans more validation points to share). So, overall we’d say Q1 saw a rebound in optimism relative to the end of 2024, or at least a stabilization – the electric segment is viewed not as collapsing, but as facing challenges that can be overcome with time and innovation. This insight suggests messaging in Q1 that focused on solutions (e.g., highlighting fast-charge tech, improving range) resonated better than doom narratives.  
* Evolution of Discussion Topics: The rank of dominant themes remained similar, but there were a few evolving angles:  
  * Range/Charging remained \#1 theme, but Q1 discussions included more about charging infrastructure initiatives. For example, some news about charging networks adding motorcycle-friendly charging or proposals for curbside charging points in London popped up, which weren’t much discussed in Q4. Also, whereas in Q4 many lamented “no progress in range,” in Q1 there was talk of upcoming bikes claiming slightly better ranges (e.g., upcoming higher battery Zero models or the potential of Honda’s battery swap system for scooters). It’s incremental, but the narrative is slowly moving from pure complaint to *“what’s being done about it.”*  
  * Performance topic gained a new facet with *comparisons of new models:* Q4 didn’t have the Del Mar (LiveWire) in customers’ hands yet, but by Q1 it was being test ridden in the US and reviewed in UK press. Thus, discussions comparing LiveWire Del Mar vs Zero SR/F vs Energica Eva etc. picked up. This created a richer performance debate (each bike has different strengths: Del Mar agile roadster, Zero SR/F higher top-end, Energica outright fastest but heaviest). Enthusiasts engaged in these nuanced comparisons, whereas earlier the talk was more binary (electric vs petrol). This indicates a maturing conversation – enthusiasts are now comparing electric *models* against each other, a sign the segment is being taken more seriously.  
  * Design/Heritage became a slightly bigger theme in Q1 thanks to events like the *Motorcycle Live show* in Birmingham (late November 2024\) where many got to see and sit on these bikes. People posted about the look and feel after seeing them in person, which often solidified opinions (positive for LiveWire’s quality and BMW’s styling, negative for some Zero’s simpler finish). Additionally, with multiple brands, the “which brand do you trust” debate grew – many expressed that they trust BMW or Honda to eventually “get it right” more than startup brands, bringing brand heritage into an argument for future purchase decisions.  
  * New Trend – Swappable Batteries and E-Scooters: One emerging topic in Q1 (less relevant to BMW specifically but contextually important) was the concept of battery swapping for electric mopeds/scooters. There were academic and industry talks about standardizing swappable batteries (as seen in Asia). Some UK discussions touched on this as a solution for urban electric two-wheelers. Honda’s forthcoming Electric scooter with swappable batteries was mentioned​  
  * [bennetts.co.uk](https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/features/electric-motorcycles/guide#:~:text=Because%2C%20like%20it%20or%20not%2C,time%20to%20start%20paying%20attention)  
  * . This suggests a bifurcation in themes: heavy bikes focus on fast-charging and bigger batteries, while small bikes/scooters might go swapping. BMW’s CE 04 doesn’t use swapping, but this trend could inform future product strategy (perhaps for smaller CE 02 or other urban models).  
* Competitive Moves & Market Activity: BMW Motorrad itself had no new electric model launch in Q1, but it did present strong overall sales results for 2024 (including over 20,000 units of CE 04/CE 02 sold globally)​  
* [press.bmwgroup.com](https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/usa/article/detail/T0447547EN_US/bmw-motorrad-presents-the-strongest-sales-result-in-company-history?language=en_US#:~:text=Strong%20performance%20of%20the%20BMW,000%20units)  
*  which was noted in press. This positions BMW as a silent strong player (even if UK numbers are small). Zero Motorcycles in Q1 focused on securing funding and announced some 2025 model updates, but they face headwinds; community perception of Zero is steady – good bikes, but company needs to grow (some news of Zero raising $120M capital​  
* [motorcyclesdata.com](https://www.motorcyclesdata.com/2024/12/09/zero-motorcycles/#:~:text=Electric%20motorcycle%20company%20Zero%20is,far%20from%20two%20undisclosed%20investors)  
* ​  
* [motorcyclesdata.com](https://www.motorcyclesdata.com/2024/12/09/zero-motorcycles/#:~:text=of%20capital)  
*  circulated, which hard-core followers discussed in terms of long-term viability). Energica was relatively quiet in Q1 as it reorganized – no new UK dealer news or models, which led to less chatter (their absence from EICMA 2023 news was noted​  
* [electricmotorcycleforum.com](https://www.electricmotorcycleforum.com/boards/index.php?topic=12910.0#:~:text=EICMA%202023%20,the%20frame%2C%20suspension%20and%20motor)  
* ). LiveWire was very active: delivering the first Del Mars and heavily marketing in the US; in the UK, they ran demo events and started expanding dealerships (as announced in 2023​  
* [thepack.news](https://thepack.news/livewire-one-electric-motorcycles-launch-in-europe/#:~:text=LiveWire%20announced%20the%20introduction%20of,equipped%20with%20specialist%20EV%20support)  
* ). This kept LiveWire in UK news, and the *sentiment toward LiveWire brand improved* as riders saw a lower-priced model (Del Mar \~£17k vs the original LiveWire £28k) making the tech a bit more accessible​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/advice/best/electric-motorbikes/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Livewire%20S2%20Del%20Mar,left%20side%20on%20the%20road)  
* ​  
* [motorcyclenews.com](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/advice/best/electric-motorbikes/#:~:text=,the%20year%20winner%20for%202024)  
* . Competitor Activity: We also saw second-tier competitors like Maeving (UK startup with a retro electric bike) continuing to gain a small fan base – their launch of a faster model (RM1S) was covered in niche media​  
* [m.youtube.com](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=f5gdQRrAR98#:~:text=The%20UK%27s%20Slickest%20Electric%20Motorcycle,selling)  
* , adding to the theme that local startups aim to fill certain gaps (in this case, lightweight city bikes). While not directly competing with BMW’s segment (more with 125cc class), it’s part of the overall EV bike landscape this quarter. Another note: some academic and market reports released around Q1 (e.g., by IMARC Group​  
* [imarcgroup.com](https://www.imarcgroup.com/uk-electric-motorcycles-market#:~:text=UK%20Electric%20Motorcycles%20Market%20Size%2C,2033)  
*  and the Motorcycle Industry Association) provided fresh data – such as market size projections and registration stats. These were occasionally cited in discussions or used in news articles, contributing to a more data-driven tone in some conversations (e.g., quoting “UK electric motorcycles market valued $1.4B in 2024” or growth forecasts). Such information wasn’t as front-and-center in casual chats before, and indicates a maturation where people back arguments with figures.  
* Implications for BMW (Insights): Comparing to the previous quarter, it’s clear BMW stands at an interesting crossroads in the UK electric narrative. In late 2024, BMW’s CE 04 was often lumped in articles about “also available electric scooters” but not the star of the show. In Q1 2025, the CE 04 started getting its own spotlight (like making that *Top 10 Maxi-Scooters 2025* list​  
* [lexhaminsurance.co.uk](https://www.lexhaminsurance.co.uk/blog/top-10-maxi-scooters/#:~:text=10%20BMW%20CE%2004%20,Price%20%C2%A312%2C190)  
* ). This suggests growing recognition of BMW’s product in its category. The sentiment towards the CE 04 specifically remains mixed: riders love its looks and tech, but many echo that “half the price and three times the range would be better” (as one Visordown commenter quipped) – essentially encapsulating the work BMW has to do​  
* [facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10159559085991131&id=126716431130#:~:text=,3%20yrs)  
* . An insight here is that BMW’s brand strength gives it credibility (little negative said about build quality or ride of the CE 04), so if they can address the common EV pain points, they stand to convert a lot of curious onlookers into customers. The competitive insight is that BMW currently doesn’t face a like-for-like electric bike rival in the UK (Zero and Energica don’t make scooters; LiveWire’s bikes are higher performance). But that will change if, say, Yamaha or Honda release a maxi-scooter EV. Thus, BMW has a first-mover advantage in the premium scooter space – the Q1 analysis shows they should capitalize on that now while others are absent.

Finally, major changes since last quarter in a nutshell: the mood is cautiously improving, the conversation is broadening to include future entrants, and consumer expectations are slowly aligning with reality (less hype, more practical evaluation). Electric motorcycles remain a small but vibrant discussion topic in the UK. Going forward, Q2 2025 will likely build on this with the first real-world user reports of some new models (e.g., if Del Mar reaches UK customers or if any pilot programs start). BMW can look at this quarter as the baseline from which to measure their progress in winning hearts and minds. The overarching insight is that the segment is transitioning from novelty toward early mainstream adoption, and Q1 2025 captured that turning point where discussions weren’t just *“what is this odd thing”* but *“how does this compare and when should I consider it.”* That’s a positive trajectory for BMW and all players in the electric motorcycle arena in the UK.
