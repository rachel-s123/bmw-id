   - **Rationale**: High importance. Brand comparisons (Zero vs BMW vs Harley) and heritage perceptions strongly shape the Portuguese market. Discussions frequently mention BMW's standing relative to rivals.
   - **Consumer Insight**: BMW's established heritage and stability contribute to a favorable perception in this emerging segment. In a market carefully considering new technology adoption, a trusted legacy brand provides reassurance and confidence.

6. **Charging Infrastructure** - WRI Score: 87.0
   - **Rationale**: Very high importance. Infrastructure scarcity outside urban areas is a major concern impacting practicality and limiting market growth.

7. **Community and Culture** - WRI Score: 45.0
   - **Rationale**: Low-moderate importance. Cultural or community aspects were not central in Portugal's EV bike conversations, which centered more on economics and policy.
   - **Consumer Insight**: There is little sign of a "biker culture" clash; early adopters are more concerned with incentives and practical use (e.g., police forces adopting EV bikes) than with tradition or identity. Portuguese consumers approach electric motorcycles primarily as a transportation solution rather than a lifestyle statement.

8. **Connectivity and Smart Features** - WRI Score: 28.0
   - **Rationale**: Low importance. Not a significant focus in discussions or analyses for the Portuguese market.

9. **Customization and Personalization** - WRI Score: 20.0
   - **Rationale**: Very low importance. Personalization was essentially absent from Portuguese market discussions.
   - **Consumer Insight**: Prospective buyers did not prioritize or even mention customizing their bikes; high costs and nascent infrastructure left little room for considering aesthetic or personal tweaks. This reflects the market's focus on establishing basic viability rather than personalization.

10. **Design Innovation** - WRI Score: 56.0
    - **Rationale**: Moderate importance. Technological innovation and design leadership are noted but rank below pragmatic factors.
    - **Consumer Insight**: Riders acknowledge BMW and Zero for pushing tech boundaries (patents, software) and appreciate the modern designs, but these innovations are considered only after critical issues like price and charging are addressed. Design is recognized but not a primary purchase driver in the Portuguese market.

11. **Education and Awareness** - WRI Score: 67.5
    - **Rationale**: Moderate-High importance. The very niche market status (1% share) and high volume of Q&A indicate a strong need for awareness and user education.

12. **Government Incentives and Regulations** - WRI Score: 87.0
    - **Rationale**: Very high importance. Incentives launched in Q1 are critical for offsetting high costs and stimulating demand in this price-sensitive market. Policy is a key market driver.

13. **Insurance and Financing Options** - WRI Score: 20.0
    - **Rationale**: Low importance. Not a major factor in discussions.

14. **Market Segmentation (Brand Heritage & Competition)** - WRI Score: 78.0
    - **Rationale**: High importance. Brand comparisons (Zero vs BMW vs Harley), share-of-voice dynamics (Zero leads, BMW follows), competitive positioning, and brand heritage perceptions strongly shape the market.

15. **Noise Reduction** - WRI Score: 42.5
    - **Rationale**: Low-Moderate importance. The subjective debate around sound vs. silence is present but not a primary driver.

16. **Performance and Speed** - WRI Score: 83.0
    - **Rationale**: High importance. Instant torque and acceleration are consistently praised in reviews and discussions, driving enthusiast interest and positive sentiment.

17. **Resale Value and Longevity** - WRI Score: 64.5
    - **Rationale**: Moderate-High importance. Concerns about battery degradation and uncertain long-term value impact TCO considerations, especially with the emerging used market.

18. **Safety Features** - WRI Score: 13.0
    - **Rationale**: Lowest importance. Not a focus of discussion in the Portuguese report.

19. **Sustainability and Environmental Impact** - WRI Score: 42.5
    - **Rationale**: Low-Moderate importance. While aligning with general EV trends, it's less critical than practical and economic factors in the current Portuguese discussion.

20. **Urban Mobility Solutions** - WRI Score: 74.5
    - **Rationale**: High importance. Commuting is a key practical use case, especially for scooters like the CE 04, driving positive reviews and interest. Police adoption reinforces this.
