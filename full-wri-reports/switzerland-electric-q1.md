While mentioned, they are secondary to the core concerns of range, cost, charging, and performance in driving market discussions and purchase decisions in Switzerland.

* **Community Influence is Moderate:** **Community and Culture (50.0)** plays a minor role, mostly manifesting through brand-specific enthusiast groups. Swiss riders tend to congregate in brand communities (e.g., Zero owner groups), but there isn't a broader cultural hesitation toward EVs reported. Purchase decisions hinge more on brand and performance than on tradition or peer culture.

* **Negligible Importance of Customization and Safety/Insurance:** **Customization and Personalization (15.0)**, **Safety Features (10.0)** and **Insurance/Financing (14.5)** show very low resonance, indicating they are not primary topics of concern or differentiation in the current Swiss market discourse. Early Swiss adopters are focused on core attributes, and there was virtually no mention of tailoring or personalizing the bikes.

**High Resonance Factors:**
* BMW's strong brand heritage and proven track record instill trust in the niche Swiss market, where its head-to-head competition with Zero is a focal point for buyers
* The sense that BMW offers cutting-edge innovation *within* a reliable brand framework amplifies its appeal (innovation backed by trust)
* The performance advantages of electric motorcycles create excitement while the urban mobility benefits provide practical justification

**Low Resonance Factors:**
* Broader motorcycle culture or community sentiment has minimal sway on Swiss EV decisions beyond existing brand fan groups
* Customization is absent from consumer priorities, since buyers are far more concerned with whether the bikes meet performance and quality expectations out-of-the-box
